    spectacular as that of a Saturn V at liftoff en route to the moon. In
    fact, the commanding role of the mammoth vehicle has tended to
    obscure its supporting players, the Saturn I and Saturn IB boosters.
    Chapter 11 recapitulates some of the milestones of these earlier
    rockets and describes some of the payloads and visual instrumentation

    Apollo-Saturn program rode on the launch of AS-501, the first Saturn
    V to lift off from Cape Kennedy. The decision to go "all up" on this
    launch circumvented the costly and time-consuming process of
    incremental flight testing of each stage prior to launching a
    complete vehicle. This mission, followed by troubleshooting the
    problems of AS-502, the first manned Saturn V launch (AS-503), and

    tests were uniformly successful, and the unique size and complexity
    of the clustered rocket made its success all the more remarkable.
    Midway in the Saturn flight test programs, Dr. F. A. Speer, Chief of
    MSFC's Flight Evaluation and operational Studies Division,
    Aero-Astrodynamics Laboratory, summarized the first five flights
    (which included the first live two-stage vehicle, SA-5); a summation
    that turned out to be a prognosis for all 10 vehicles of the Saturn I
    series. "All five flights were complete successes," Speer reported,
    "both in achieving all major test missions and in obtaining an
    unprecedented volume of system performance data for flight analysis."
    Speer asserted, "It is correct to state that, up to this point, no
    major unexpected design change had to be initiated on the basis of
    flight test-thus proving the design maturity of the Saturn I
    vehicle."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On 27 October 1961, the first Saturn lifted
    from the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. All the static tests, dynamic
    tests, and test firings before this first launch had pointed to a
    successful mission, but until the liftoff of SA-1, no one could say
    for certain that an eight-engine monster like the Saturn would really
    work. The long countdown demonstrated the compatibility of the ground
    support equipment, and the launch crew released the "bird" (as NASA
    crews called the rockets) with no technical "hold" to mar the
    mission. The SA-1 vehicle soared to an altitude of 137 kilometers and
    impacted the Atlantic Ocean 344 kilometers downrange.

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The 10 launches of the Saturn I booster
    included both Block I and Block II versions. The H-1 engine was
    common to all the vehicles, but a number of significant differences
    distinguished Block I from Block II. The most visible distinguishing
    feature for the Block I series, SA-1 through SA-4, was the absence of
    aerodynamic fins on the first stage. Moreover, the Block I vehicles
    did not include live upper stages. Consistent with NASA's building
    block concept and the requirements for validating the clustered
    concept first, these first Saturn I launches used live lower stages
    only. The dummy upper stages looked like the future live versions,
    had the same approximate center of gravity, and had identical weight.
    Inert S-IV and S-V stages, topped by a nose cone from an Army Jupiter
    rocket, brought the typical height of the Block I series to about 50
    meters.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The flight of SA-1 was remarkable for the
    small number of modifications that were required for succeeding
    flights. Experience gained from successive launches inevitably
    resulted in changes, but the only major difficulty that turned up
    with SA-1 was an unanticipated degree of sloshing of propellants in
    the vehicle's tanks. Beginning with vehicle SA-3, additional
    antislosh baffles were installed, which brought this undesirable
    characteristic under control. None of the Block I missions called for
    separation of the upper stages after the S-1 first-stage engine
    cutoff, although the SA-3 and SA-4 vehicles experimentally fired four
    solid-fuel retrorockets, anticipating the separation sequence of
    Block II missions. Other preliminary test items on SA-4 included
    simulated camera pods and simulated ullage rockets on the inert S-IV
    stage. The last two vehicles also carried a heavier and more active
    load of electronics and telemetry equipment. The telemetry equipment
    and associated test programs varied with the goals of each mission,
    but the total array of such gadgetry and the means of acquiring
    information help explain not only the success of the Saturn program
    but also the comparatively low number of R&amp;D flights required to
    qualify the vehicle as operational.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The flight of SA-4 culminated with only seven
    engines firing instead of eight. One of the appealing features of
    clustered engines involved the "engine-out capability"-the prospect
    that, if one engine quit, the remaining engines could compensate by
    burning longer than planned. So NASA technicians programmed a
    premature cutoff of one engine 100 seconds
    [<A NAME="325"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">325</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] into the flight. The experiment succeeded, the SA-4
    performing as hoped on the remaining seven engines.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During this basically uneventful series of
    launches, the Saturn I carried its first payloads. The missions of
    SA-2 and SA-3 included one very unusual experiment, called Project
    Highwater, authorized by NASA's Office of Space Sciences. The inert
    S-IV and S-V stages for these launches carried 109 000 liters (30 000
    gallons) of ballast water for release in the upper atmosphere. As
    NASA literature stated, "release of this vast quantity of water in a
    near-space environment marked the first purely scientific large-scale
    experiment concerned with space environments that was ever
    conducted." One of the questions apparently bothering NASA planners
    was the consequences of a stage explosion in space or the necessity
    of destroying one of the Saturn rockets at a high altitude. What
    would happen to the clouds of liquid propellants released in the
    upper atmosphere? Would there be radio transmission difficulties?
    What would it do to local weather conditions? Project Highwater gave
    answers to these questions. At an altitude of 105 kilometers,
    explosive devices ruptured the S-IV and S-V tanks, and in just five
    seconds, ground observers saw the formation of a huge ice cloud
    estimated to be several kilometers in diameter, swirling above the
    spent stage to a height of 145 kilometers above the sea. It was a
    dramatic sight for the observers below at Cape Kennedy and marked the
    first use of the Saturn launch vehicles for a purely scientific
    mission.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During 1964, introduction of the Saturn I
    Block II vehicles marked a new milestone in large launch vehicle
    development. To the casual observer, the most obvious distinction was
    the addition of the eight aerodynamic fins to the lower stage for
    enhanced stability in flight. As far as NASA was concerned, the most
    significant feature of Block II was the addition of a live upper
    stage, the S-IV, built by Douglas. Moreover, the S-IV stage also
    marked the inauguration of liquid hydrogen propellant technology in
    the Saturn vehicle program; six RL-10 liquid hydrogen rocket engines
    supplied by Pratt &amp; Whitney were used. These engines in the upper
    stage would allow orbital operations for the first time in Saturn I
    launches. Above the S-IV stage, the Block II vehicles also carried
    the first instrument canisters for guidance and control. The
    instrument canister controlled the powered ascent of the big rocket
    and carried an array of sensing and evaluation equipment for
    telemetry acquisition from the ground.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to the untried cluster of six
    RL-10 liquid hydrogen engines for the S-IV, the Block II Saturns
    relied on uprated, 836 000-newton (188 000-pound) thrust H-1 engines,
    that gave the first stage a total thrust of slightly over 6 672 000
    newtons (1.5 million pounds). Further, the new engines powered an
    improved S-1 first stage. The length of the propellant containers,
    for instance, had been increased to provide additional propellants
    for the uprated engines. Despite the added weight penalty

    an overall gain in efficiency of the Saturn I first stage because of
    numerous changes. These included, for example, weight savings through
    simplification of the propellant interchange system that lessened the
    amount of residual fuel and oxidizer trapped in the propellant
    interchange lines. Heightened confidence in the reliability of the
    H-1 engines enabled reduction of the holddown time at launch from 3.6
    seconds to 3.1 seconds; this savings shifted an additional 0.5 second
    of maximum boost to the powered flight phase, thereby enhancing the
    vehicle's performance. Efficiency of propellant depletion was also
    increased as a result of experience and numerous subsystems changes.
    The first SA-1 vehicle used 96.1 percent of its fuel, for example; by
    the time of the flight of SA-10, the use had reached 99.3 percent.
    Payload capability was also increased by reducing the amount of
    pressurants on board. The height of the Block II rockets

    With a Jupiter nose cone, SA-5 was about 50 meters high, but the

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although electronic instrumentation and
    telemetry provided reams of pertinent information on the health and
    performance of the rocket during a mission, flight-test personnel
    needed visual documentation as well. For this reason, the Saturn
    vehicles all carried an invaluable array of visual instrumentation
    equipment. The Block II series continued the visual instrumentation
    that was begun during Block I flights. MSFC engineers wanted very
    much to know about the behavior of propellants within the vehicle
    during flight, so a number of different visual instrumentation
    systems were carried. Great attention was given to on-board
    television systems. Work with on-board TV began at MSFC early in 1959
    under the cognizance of the Astrionics Division. Research emphasized
    the development of a compact and extremely rugged camera to stand up
    under the punishment of liftoff, boost phase, and free trajectory
    coast in extreme temperature and pressure environments. MSFC tried
    out the system on 31 January 1961 on the Mercury-Redstone that
    carried the chimpanzee Ham. The real-time, high-resolution
    transmitting system worked very well from liftoff across the optical
    horizon to about 320 kilometers distant. At the same time, the MSFC
    group was perfecting multiple-camera, single-transmitter equipment
    for the Saturn I missions; it became operational just prior to SA-1
    in the fall of 1961. The system offered "real-time display and
    permanent storage of pictures televised from the vehicle during test
    flight." As mounted on SA-6, for example, two camera locations were
    utilized. On the ground, a videotape recorder and a kinescope
    recorder provided real-time viewing and storage capability. To
    identify each picture image, the kinescope recorder system included a
    digital key, indicating the camera position and time-of-flight
    reference. Within five minutes of a completed flight, high-resolution
    individual shots could be available for study.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Television was originally selected for use on
    rockets because recovery of motion picture film seemed uncertain.
    Still, the TV units had limitations because a number of critical
    vehicle functions were not compatible with television camera
    operations and imagery. For this reason, the Saturn I flights also
    incorporated motion picture coverage of test flights.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A technique to incorporate such coverage was
    successfully demonstrated during the Redstone program in 1961 when
    inflight photographic instrumentation captured the separation of a
    warhead from a Redstone rocket booster. Early in the Saturn
    development program, investigators recognized the need for a similar
    photo system for visual analysis of phenomena that could not be
    simulated during ground testing or acquired through vehicle
    telemetry. Plans provided for inflight
    [<A NAME="328"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">328</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] motion picture and television coverage for the first
    stage of the SA-1 mission in October 1961 on the basis of the
    Redstone camera technology. Lack of time and money prevented use of
    such equipment for the first Saturn launches, and effort was
    redirected toward the mission of SA-5, the first live, two-stage
    Saturn I. Responsibility for the camera became a joint program of
    MSFC's Astrionics Laboratory and the Propulsion and Vehicle
    Engineering Laboratory. With approval for the project in October
    1961, Marshall named Cook Technological Center, a division of the
    Cook Electric Company of Chicago, as the major contractor. Cook
    Technological Center then proceeded with the development and
    manufacture of jettisonable and recoverable camera capsules to be
    flown on SA-5, 6, and 7.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The camera capsules consisted of three
    sections: the lens compartment, with camera lens and a quartz viewing
    window; the combined camera and its control unit in a separate
    compartment; and a recovery compartment, housing descent
    stabilization flaps and a paraballoon for descent and flotation, a
    radio and light beacon for aid in recovery operations, and more
    conventional recovery devices such as sea-marker dye and shark
    repellant. The capsules were designed to cope with the stresses of
    powered flight, ejection, reentry, impact into the sea, and immersion
    in saltwater. Four model "A" capsules were positioned to record
    external areas of the Saturn vehicle, facing forward. Four more model
    "B" capsules were mounted in an inverted position to record the
    phenomena inside designated LOX tanks and around the interstage
    between first and second stages. For the "B" models, technicians
    linked the cameras with fiberoptic bundles to transmit images from
    remote locations and used incandescent lights and strobe systems for
    illumination. Engineers preferred to use color film whenever possible
    because it provided a better three-dimensional image than the gray
    tones of the black and white film. One camera used an extremely fast
    and sensitive black and white film to record phenomena inside the
    center LOX tank because of the lighting inside the
    tank.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The launch of SA-5, 29 January 1964, was what
    NASA liked to call "a textbook launch." As the first Block II
    vehicle, the SA-5 recorded a number of firsts: first S-IV stage to
    fly, first guidance and control packages, and first successful stage
    separation. The SA-5 was the first Saturn using uprated engines,
    marked the first successful recovery of motion picture camera pods,
    and was the first orbital Saturn vehicle.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although SA-6 got off the launch pad without a
    hitch, it caused a moment of concern among mission controllers when
    one of the H-1 engines inexplicably shut off prematurely. Unlike
    SA-4, this was not part of the programmed flight, but the Saturn
    performed beautifully, proving the engine-out capability built into
    it by Marshall engineers. With hardly a perturbation, the vehicle
    continued its upward climb; stage separation and orbit of the S-IV
    upper stage went as planned. Telemetry pinpointed
    [<A NAME="329"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">329</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] the engine problem in the number 8 engine turbopump,
    which shut down at 117.3 seconds into the flight. When telemetered
    information was analyzed, engineers concluded that the teeth had been
    stripped from one of the gears in the turbopump, accounting for the
    abrupt failure of the engine. Luckily, Marshall and Rocketdyne
    technicians, through previous ground testing of the turbopump, had
    already decided that its operating characteristics dictated a
    modified design. A change had already been planned to increase the
    width of the gear teeth in this particular turbopump model, and the
    redesigned flight hardware was to fly on the next vehicle, SA-7.
    Consequently, there were no delays in the Block II launch schedule
    and, incidentally, no further problems with any of the H-1 engines in
    flight.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Otherwise, the flight of SA-6 was eminently
    successful. The SA-6 was the first to carry a dummy Apollo capsule
    into orbit, and it tested the capsule by jettisoning the launch
    escape system tower, part of the Apollo spacecraft hardware
    development. The performance of the Block II series progressed so
    well that the Saturn I boosters were declared fully operational by
    NASA officials after the SA-7 flight (18 September 1964), three
    launches earlier than expected. The unmanned Apollo spacecraft on
    board met guidelines for design and engineering, compatibility of the
    spacecraft and launch vehicle, and operation of the launch escape
    system. The launch also confirmed the integrity of major critical
    areas of the launch vehicle such as the Saturn I propulsion systems,
    flight control, guidance, and structural integrity. For SA-7, the
    only event that might be considered an anomaly involved the recovery
    of the cameras. After stage separation, the jettisoned camera pods
    descended by parachute and landed in the sea, downrange of the
    expected recovery area. Then Hurricane Gladys blew in and closed the
    sector. Seven weeks later, two of the ejected SA-7 camera capsules
    washed ashore, encrusted with barnacles, but with the important films
    undamaged.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    instrument unit with more sophisticated components that did not
    require separate, pressurized sections; the result was a lighter and

    environmental control system, the new instrument unit was the
    prototype for the Saturn IB and Saturn V vehicles. The most
    significant feature that set all three vehicles apart from their
    predecessors was the payload-the unusual, winglike meteoroid

    standpoint of designing later versions of the Saturn vehicles. Data
    collected by Pegasus would either confirm the ability of existing
    designs to operate without danger from meteoroid impact or require
    new designs to cope with the dangers of meteoroid collisions. The
    Pegasus project was an example of the painstaking scope of the
    Apollo-Saturn program research and development to avert any sort of
    serious problem. Finally, the project demonstrated several ways in
    which the operation contributed to the general store of scientific
    knowledge, as well as to the design and operation of boosters,
    spacecraft, and associated systems.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    at speeds up to 72 kilometers per second. A dust-speck particle,
    weighing a mere 0.0085 gram, at such a speed packs the energy of a
    .45-caliber pistol fired point blank. Meteoroid phenomena in the
    near-Earth space environment commanded serious attention, the more so
    because many critical moments of manned Apollo-Saturn missions
    occurred in potentially hazardous zones. The Gemini spacecraft
    experienced meteoroid impacts many times during a 24-hour period, but
    the specks encountered in the lower Gemini orbits were too small to
    cause a puncture in the spacecraft skin. Higher orbits for the Apollo
    series raised concerns about heavier meteoroid particles. "It is the
    stuff of intermediate size that concerns a space-vehicle designer,"
    Wernher von Braun emphasized. "Particles of only a few thousandths of
    a gram, whizzing at fifteen to twenty miles a second, can penetrate a
    spacecraft's wall or a rocket's tank. They constitute a definite
    risk." A meteoroid puncture in a gas compartment or propellant tank
    could cause a serious leak, and in the case of a highly pressurized
    container create an explosive rupture. Particles also created heat at
    the moment of impact. With highly volatile propellants aboard, as
    well as the oxygen-enriched cabin atmosphere, penetration by a
    burning meteoroid would touch off a destructive explosion. Even
    without complete penetration, impacts could cause "spalling." The
    shock of impact with the skin of a spacecraft could eject fragments
    from the skin's interior surface to ricochet inside the vehicle.
    These flying fragments raised a serious possibility of danger to a
    crew or to vital equipment. The need for information was

    operations to give Saturn I something to do and to placate critics
    who complained that the Saturn was contributing little to science.
    There is probably some truth in these allegations. Highwater in
    particular seems to have been an impromptu operation, revealing

    launches was not very earthshaking. None of the three satellites
    promoted any fantastic new discoveries; no dramatic design changes
    occurred in either the Saturn launch vehicles or the Apollo
    spacecraft as a result of unexpected information about meteoroid
    penetration. The value of the Pegasus involved a positive, rather
    than a negative, reading of the test results. The satellites
    confirmed basic estimates about meteoroid frequency and penetration
    in the operational environment of the Apollo-Saturn vehicles. This
    confirmation provided a firm base of knowledge to proceed with basic
    designs already in the works. In fact, it was good that the Pegasus
    series did not turn up significantly different data, which would have
    entailed costly redesign and additional time and research into
    meteoroid phenomena as related to boosters and spacecraft. Instead,
    the effect was to add to the growing confidence of Apollo-Saturn
    designs already in process and to permit NASA to plunge ahead toward
    the goal of landing man on the moon within the decade. It would have
    been easy to dismiss what was, in fact, a successful developmental

    development of the communications satellite (comsat) project, because
    the results indicated that the comsat satellites would indeed have a
    profitable lifetime in orbit, the probability being high that they
    would survive or escape damage from meteoroids. Wernher von Braun was

    module's heat shield could withstand the intense temperatures created
    by atmospheric friction during reentry. The first Saturn IB
    experienced relatively few problems in flight, although the mission
    was nearly canceled during countdown. Bad weather delayed the launch
    date for three days, and on the day of the liftoff, launch officials
    postponed the firing command for three hours while technicians did
    some trouble-shooting on several last-minute technical problems. The
    most serious difficulty involved the gaseous nitrogen purge system
    that cleaned out the engines and the related machinery prior to
    launch. At T-4 seconds, the gaseous nitrogen pressure limits had
    dropped below the red-line level and an automatic cutoff sequence was
    started. After resetting the equipment and starting the countdown
    once more, at T-5 minutes engineers perceived the problem again and
    requested a hold. Engineers estimated that it would possibly take two
    hours of work to recheck and reset all the equipment. Reluctantly,
    the recommendation was made to scrub the launch. Still searching for
    options, a group of launch crew engineers suggested a different test
    of the system to assess other alternatives, and stage engineers
    agreed; so the countdown was restarted at T-15 with the gaseous
    nitrogen pressures reset at different levels. The countdown and

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The second launch of the Saturn IB series, on
    5 July 1966, carried an out-of-sequence number designation, AS-203.
    Originally scheduled for the second launch in the series, AS-202
    became third in line to gain additional time for checkout of its
    Apollo spacecraft payload. NASA made the announcement in April,
    explaining that the AS-203 mission primarily involved launch vehicle
    development. Mission objectives for the second Saturn IB launch
    concentrated on the orbital characteristics and operation of the
    S-IVB second stage, so the vehicle had a simple aerodynamic nose cone
    in place of the Apollo spacecraft. Launch officials considered the
    second stage itself, with 10 metric tons of liquid hydrogen aboard,
    as the payload. Testing was scheduled to gain further information
    about liquid hydrogen in the orbital environment and about procedures
    for reignition of the S-IVB in orbit, a requirement for Saturn V
    missions in the future. The reignition sequence was not to be live
    but simulated with the S-IVB and J-2 engine systems. In an attempt to
    telescope development of the stage and engine operations, last-minute
    consideration was given to an actual restart of the J-2 engine. A
    number of people within Marshall Space Flight Center, however,
    opposed restarting the J-2 because that would unduly complicate the
    developmental flight. In a letter to Major General Samuel C.
    Phillips, Eberhard Rees estimated that a complete restart sequence
    would require an additional 1800 kilograms of liquid oxygen and 1400
    kilograms of other equipment and provisions and would compromise the
    main test goals of the behavior of liquid hydrogen in the orbital
    environment as well as other test procedures. "Douglas and MSFC are
    confident that a successful AS-203 mission, as presently defined,"
    said Rees, "should establish whether or not successful restarts can
    be accomplished on Saturn V missions."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For reignition under weightless conditions,
    fuel and oxidizer had to be settled in the bottoms of the propellant
    tanks. Engineers hoped to achieve this through the use of the
    hydrogen continuous vent system. The venting gas imparted thrust
    which pushed the propellants to the bottom of the tanks. This thrust
    could be augmented by occasionally opening the liquid oxygen tank
    propulsive vent valve. To study the stability of the liquid hydrogen
    in orbit and to check settling of the liquid hydrogen at the bottom
    of the tanks, the S-IVB carried a pair of TV cameras mounted inside
    the tank. Prior to launch, a checkout of the TV system uncovered
    trouble in one of the cameras. After a hold of almost two hours, NASA
    engineers decided not to postpone the launch any longer and the
    vehicle lifted off with only one of the cameras expected to work.
    Fortunately, the remaining camera functioned well, and the
    [<A NAME="340"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">340</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] images verified the hopes for proper propellant
    behavior during venting and for settling of the propellants prior to
    reignition. Motion picture color coverage of stage separation,
    recovered from the ocean in one of the camera capsules, was also of
    high quality and showed the desired performance.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Following the satisfactory TV coverage of the
    behavior of liquid hydrogen under weightless conditions and a
    simulated restart of the J-2, technicians proceeded with the plan to
    break up the S-IVB stage in orbit. This rather dramatic procedure was
    intended to verify ground tests that had been carried out on
    structural test models at Douglas facilities on the West Coast.
    Investigators from Douglas and MSFC wanted to establish design limits
    and the point of structural failure for the S-IVB common bulkhead
    when pressure differential developed in the propellant tanks. Ground
    tests were one thing; the orbital environment of space was another.
    Breakup occurred near the start of the fifth orbit when the common
    bulkhead failed and the stage disinte-grated. The results confirmed
    the Douglas ground experiments; the S-IVB stage could withstand
    tankage pressure differentials over three times that expected for

    to the suborbital mission profile because the primary purpose was to
    test the heat shield on the command module (CM). Extensive holds,
    taking up three days, had been caused by problems with the spacecraft
    and ground telemetry. With the problems finally resolved, the AS-202
    vehicle lifted off in a flawless launch. The S-IVB successfully
    tested its ullage rockets and ignited as planned despite some minor
    valve malfunctions in the recirculation system of the J-2. Separation
    of the S-IVB and the CM caused oscillatory motions of the S-IVB,
    which could have made for tricky maneuvers for CM docking with the
    lunar module (LM) in manned missions, but the S-IVB auxiliary
    propulsion system brought the stage back under control. In accordance
    with the planned profile, the CM made a "skipping" reentry to raise
    the heat loads and subject the heat shield to maximum punishment.

    Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, announced that the mission originally
    scheduled for Grissom, White, and Chaffee would be known as Apollo 1
    and said that the first Saturn V launch, scheduled for November 1967,

    lifted off from Launch Complex 37 at KSC on 22 January 1968 in an
    unmanned test of the lunar module in Earth orbit. The LM was enclosed
    in a spacecraft-lunar-module adapter and topped by an aerodynamic
    nose cone in place of the Apollo command and service modules (CSM).
    Evaluation of the LM included ignition of the descent and ascent
    stages and LM staging and structures. Engineers also intended to
    conduct an S-IVB propellant dumping experiment in orbit, following
    separation of the stage from the LM. Dumping was considered necessary
    to make the S-IVB safe before docking of the CSM with the
    S-IVB-attached LM.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Some months prior to the AS-204 mission, NASA
    planners realized that the vehicle was going to be sitting stacked on
    pad 37 for a considerable period of time awaiting the arrival of the
    LM. NASA took advantage of the opportunity to monitor the conditions
    of the launch vehicle over a long period of time, as it stood on the
    pad exposed to the elements on the Florida coast. On 7 April 1967,
    the first stage had been erected; the second stage and the instrument
    unit were added in the next four days. Marshall and contractor
    personnel devised a detailed set of criteria for periodic inspections
    of the vehicle starting that same month. No components had to be
    replaced because of corrosion; advance planning had paid off. The
    vehicle was under constant nitrogen purges to protect the engine
    compartment and other equipment areas from the salty atmosphere. The
    vehicle propellant tanks were also kept under pressure with dry
    nitrogen. These procedures were maintained during a kind of musical
    chairs operation as the LM and its associated hardware were moved in
    and out, off and on, for several weeks. After arrival of its ascent
    and descent engines and their mating, they had to be taken apart in
    August to repair leaks in the ascent engine. Then the two stages were
    mated again until September when a new leak required demating.
    Several items of LM hardware had to be shipped back to the contractor
    for additional work. The ascent and descent engines of the LM were
    put together again in October, and tests were run until November when
    the spacecraft was taken to the pad and mechanically mated with the
    booster. The flight readiness tests were not accomplished with the
    total vehicle until late in December with the LM in position, nearly
    nine months after the launch vehicle had been put in place on Launch
    Complex 37.</FONT></P>
