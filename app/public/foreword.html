    FACE="Geneva">xi</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Few of man's
    technological endeavors compare in scope of significance to the
    development of the Saturn family of launch vehicles.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the time of this writing in 1979, we may
    still be too close to the project to see it objectively from the
    perspective of history, but I expect that future historians will
    compare the development of Saturn to such great and imaginative
    projects as the building of the Panama Canal and to such latter-day
    technological achievements as the Manhattan Project. In terms of both
    vision and achievement, Saturn may surpass them all.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It was as if the Wright Brothers had gone from
    building their original Wright Flyer in 1903 to developing a
    supersonic Concorde in 1913. Unimaginable; yet in 10 short years the
    builders of Saturn progressed from the small, single-engine rockets
    like Redstone to the giant vehicle with clustered engines that put
    man on the moon. Our Earth-to-orbit weight-lifting capability grew in
    that decade by 10 thousand times. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Saturn was an engineering masterpiece. The
    ultimate Saturn, taller than the Statue of Liberty, had a takeoff
    weight that exceeded that of 25 fully loaded jet airliners, and
    produced as much power as 85 Hoover Dams.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Saturn program was also a masterpiece of
    management. There are those who hold that one of the principal
    benefits this country derived from the Apollo-Saturn lunar landing
    program was the development of a new and extraordinary management
    approach through which the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration directed vast human and material resources toward a
    common purpose. The system that was developed to meet the incredible
    complexities of the program, taking account of its pioneering nature
    and the time constraint imposed, provides a pattern for managing a
    broad spectrum of future technological, scientific, and social
    endeavors. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One of the most remarkable things about the
    Saturn program was its success rate. An early press release openly
    stated that because of the [<A NAME="xii"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">xii</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] complexity of the
    system and the tremendous advancement in technology required, program
    officials fully expected half of the 10 Saturn I's launched to fail.
    None did. Neither did any Saturn 1B, nor did any Saturn V, either
    test vehicle or operational rocket-and there were 32 Saturn launches
    in all.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The reliability assessment of the system was
    such that only two Saturn Vs were launched before the third sent
    Frank Borman's crew around the moon during Christmas of 1968. In all,
    27 men went around the moon aboard Saturn-launched space vehicles, 12
    actually walked on its surface.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Close on the heels of the lunar landing
    series, NASA developed Skylab, the world's first major laboratory in
    which we could operate experiments in the new environment of space.
    The Saturn again played a pivotal role in this enterprise-the core
    component of the Skylab itself being a modified Saturn stage. Only a
    Saturn V could lift the huge laboratory into orbit, which, when an
    Apollo spacecraft was annexed, weighed 100 metric tons and was 36
    meters long. The three crews, which inhabited the space station for a
    total time of nearly six months, were launched on the smaller Saturn
    IBs. The Saturn family made Skylab possible, so Saturn deserves a
    large share of the credit for the mission's success in establishing a
    broad foundation of scientific and technological knowledge.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Furthermore, we should not overlook the role
    Saturn played in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project of 1975. It was
    another Saturn IB that carried an American crew to its historic
    rendezvous with two Soviet cosmonauts in orbit. The reliable Saturn
    gave NASA every confidence that its crew could ascend on schedule
    following the Soviet launch half a world away and make the
    time-critical union of those two small objects in space. We had a
    high level of confidence that this, the last Saturn, would perform
    with the same excellence as its 31 predecessors. It did not
    disappoint us.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It should be pointed out that the
    Apollo-Saturn program was a national achievement. It has been
    estimated that 20 000 private firms and 300 000 people participated
    in the development of this system. The challenge taxed American
    ingenuity to the extreme. The result, of course, was that American
    technology made the "giant leap" referred to by Neil Armstrong. Whole
    new industries were born, offering products that touch our everday
    lives in ways we could not have dreamed of just a decade
    before.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">We may not soon again face a challenge to
    match the lunar landing, and it may be some time before we mount the
    kind of scientific and engineering effort that gave us Saturn.
    Whenever that next challenge comes, we have in the Apollo-Saturn
    program the basic blueprint for achieving success. It not only will
    point the way but will also give the confidence needed to undertake
    new and dramatic challenges.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="xiii"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">xiii</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Among the other
    lessons learned from the development of Saturn is the evidence of how
    much a free society can do and how far a dedicated people can go when
    they are properly challenged, led, motivated, and supported.</FONT>
