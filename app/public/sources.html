    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This history rests primarily on documents
    acquired for the Saturn history project, under a contract awarded to
    the University of Alabama in Huntsville by MSFC in 1968. Documents in
    the Saturn history project (SHP) amount to approximately 24 file
    drawers and are currently housed in the library of the University of
    Alabama in Huntsville. Although the SHP files contain letters,
    memoranda, and other documents copied from the History Office at NASA
    Headquarters, as well as some material from the Kennedy and Johnson
    Presidential Libraries, their principal strength is represented in
    other aspects. The SHP files are primarily a collection of MSFC
    documents and materials gathered from contractors involved in the
    Saturn program. These documents include many unpublished reports and
    summaries prepared for miscellaneous briefings and professional
    meetings. Where no official control number was included, the source
    has been identified as NASA Report, Douglas Report, etc.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Many engineers who were involved in the Saturn
    program read papers at professional meetings of the American
    Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and many were reprinted
    and cited herein as AIAA Paper No. 0000, etc. These AIAA papers were
    very valuable in coming to grips with many key areas in Saturn
    development, in discussing problems encountered, in trouble-shooting,
    and in assessing the solutions adopted. For the most part, these
    papers are notably candid and, because their authors were directly
    associated with Saturn hardware, can be regarded as useful primary
    sources. The SHP files also include selected correspondence, test
    reports, flight summaries, press kits, and other miscellaneous
    documents from NASA and contractor sources.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although the files themselves are arranged in
    chronological order, there is an extensive and detailed index
    arranged by subject. The index is fully cross-referenced and
    annotated. Additional documents, acquired during later phases of the
    Saturn history, are housed with the SHP files, although they still
    await indexing and location within the original files.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Finally, the SHP files include tapes,
    transcripts, and notes of 128 interviews with NASA and contractor
    personnel who worked on the Saturn rockets. Unhappily, some of the
    interviews were recorded on tapes of inferior quality and the
    transcriptions are only marginal or fragmentary. A number of other
    transcriptions, although prepared from audible tapes, were so poorly
    transcribed as to be unusable. Notes were taken of several interviews
    when use of recording equipment was either impractical or impossible.
    Other interviews, housed in the files of Johnson Space Center or at
    NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., are so identified in the
    backnotes.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In identifying authorship or affiliation with
    government agencies and contractors, the following abbreviations have
    been used:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA (National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">MSFC (Marshall Space Flight Center)</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">KSC (Kennedy Space Center)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">JSC (Johnson Space Center)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">MDAC (McDonnell Douglas Astronautics
    Company)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NAR (North American Rockwell)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In citing interviews, these abbreviations have
    also been used to indicate the affiliation of the person who gave the
    interview. "NASA" in the interviews identifies individuals primarily
    associated with NASA Headquarters in Washington. Although von Braun
    was interviewed while he was attached to NASA Headquarters (as Deputy
    Associate Administrator for Planning) following his departure from
    MSFC in March 1970, I have identified him as an affiliate of MSFC
    because of his close association with Marshall and the Saturn
    program.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Several other documentary sources were used in
    writing the Saturn history. The files of the Historical Office,
    Marshall Space Flight Center, although including miscellaneous
    correspondence, were strongest in the series of monthly, quarterly,
    and annual progress reports of major laboratories and individual MSFC
    programs. These files were especially useful in establishing
    chronological sequences and specific dates. Other files consulted are
    now in MSFC's Records Holding Area. These include the Director's
    Reading Files (1960-1969); Office of the Director, "Weekly Notes"
    (1960-1968); Industrial Operations, Director's Reading Files
    (1960-1970); Industrial Operations, Record Files (1960-1970). I was
    unable, apparently because of internal bureaucratic inertia, to gain
    access to these files until a late phase of research. Fortunately, I
    do not seem to have missed much. The files were disappointingly thin
    in any matter of substance and dealt mostly with day-to-day
    managerial and budgetary issues. The "Weekly Notes" were an
    exception, including several folders on special projects, as well as
    the weekly summaries from program managers and lab chiefs to von
    Braun, all with his rejoinders, queries, and directions scribbled in
    the margins.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Aside from the SHP files, the most rewarding
    source of correspondence and memos came from the historical files at
    NASA Headquarters, and from the files at Johnson Space Center. The
    latter included a wide range of direct correspondence among
    Headquarters, MSFC, and JSC. Because much correspondence from NASA
    Headquarters to JSC included information relevant to the
    Apollo-Saturn program as it involved other centers, the JSC files
    contained a remarkable amount of material pertinent to the
    Saturn.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The historian who delves into any of these
    files and expects to find signed, original documents is going to be
    disappointed. They must exist somewhere, but I did not see them.
    Apollo-Saturn not only flourished in the "age of the copier," it was
    one of its chief customers. For all practical purposes, there is
    nothing wrong with a copy, but the inability to find and actually
    handle the original takes some of the zest from historical research.
    The telephone is another obvious stumbling block in modern research.
    NASA and contractor personnel alike emphasized their reliance on the
    telephone to resolve problems and formulate policy on an ad hoc
    basis, making many decisions nearly impossible to trace. For this
    reason, interviews were often the only way to reconstruct some
    events. Wherever possible, data and controversial issues discussed in
    interviews were double checked against extant documentation, and/or
    in subsequent interviews with other people. Von Braun, however, kept
    a "Daily Journal," that listed hourly appointments, travel
    itineraries, and phone calls. Sometimes the Daily Journal included
    summaries of conversations, and sometimes it included verbatim
    transcriptions. In several instances, this made the "Daily Journal"
    an invaluable aid in understanding an event. The "Daily Journal"
    frequently included copies of memos and other instructions.</FONT>
