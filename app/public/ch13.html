    and the Americans used their man-rated space rockets for a variety of
    missions. NASA used basic Saturn hardware for launching the Skylab
    space station; Skylab itself evolved from the Saturn V third stage.
    The last Saturn rocket to be launched culminated in the linkup of a
    manned American spacecraft with its manned Soviet counterpart-the
    Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.</FONT></P>

    race in space ended in a new arena of international cooperation. The
    Saturn program left other legacies. The city of Huntsville, Alabama,
    entered a new era of social and economic vigor, since Marshall Space
    Flight Center's activities attracted nonspace commercial enterprises
    to a booming locale and injected vitality into health care,
    education, municipal services, and the arts. Finally, execution of
    the Saturn program stimulated significant research and improved
    technique across a wide range of fabrication and manufacturing

    program began in an atmosphere of international competition, the
    object of which was to beat the Russians to a manned landing on the
    moon. In terms of heavy payloads and successful manned flights,
    Soviet boosters and aeronautical sophistication seemed to set the
    pace for the exploration of space for several years after Sputnik.
    The Gemini program of the mid-1960s considerably enhanced American
    skills in manned space flight, and development of the Saturn I,
    Saturn IB, and Saturn V gave the United States a booster capability
    that surpassed the Soviet boosters. With the three-man Apollo
    spacecraft, the Apollo-Saturn combination carried not one, but seven
    manned missions to the lunar surface. In big boosters, where the
    United States had always lagged, Saturn finally retired the
    cup.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Soviet space program conducted an
    impressive series of unmanned research missions, including remote
    reconnaissance and sampling of the lunar surface by robots, and the
    return of small samples to Earth. Yet the Russians had not landed a
    cosmonaut on the moon by the mid-1970s despite some spectacular
    manned missions, involving orbital rendezvous, docking, and crew
    transfer, using Soyuz spacecraft. Although the Russians successfully
    orbited their Salyut space station in combination with manned Soyuz
    launches in 1971, Soyuz 10 did not complete the transfer of the three
    cosmonauts and the crew of Soyuz 11 died during reentry.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the meantime, the American space program
    was also moving ahead with a variety of unmanned satellites and
    probes, and the momentum of Saturn resulted in a genuine space
    station, the Skylab. The last launch of a Saturn vehicle was a
    singular event, achieving orbital [<A NAME="382"></A></FONT><B><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Skylab was the final version of several plans
    to modify the Saturn S-IVB stage so that it could be occupied by
    astronauts in space. The Skylab assembly consisted of several
    modules, including the orbital workshop (a modified S-IVB stage),
    airlock module, multiple docking adapter, and Apollo telescope mount.
    This modular payload was launched to low Earth orbit aboard a
    two-stage Saturn V, with the Skylab in the upper position normally
    occupied by the S-IVB third stage.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The idea of using a Saturn stage as a space
    station apparently developed while planning Saturn I and Saturn IB
    mission profiles. In the normal sequence of events, S-IV and S-IVB
    upper stages of these vehicles became space-age "orphans." Their
    propellants expended, the empty stages remained uselessly in orbit.
    With such large tanks circling the Earth, it was not long before some
    thoughtful engineers wondered why it would not be possible to use an
    empty stage as a habitat for astronauts. In November 1962, Douglas
    Aircraft, the S-IVB contractor, published a short study suggesting
    the use of the S-IVB as a laboratory in space. A group of engineers
    at MSFC evidently had a parallel concept in mind, although they had
    not yet committed anything to paper.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the next few years, the increasing
    tempo of the Apollo-Saturn program absorbed the thoughts and energies
    of planners at both Douglas and Marshall Space Flight Center, and
    nothing was accomplished in terms of turning a spent stage into a
    space laboratory. Early in 1965, however, program analysts at MSFC
    who were thinking ahead began to use the terms "spent stage" and "wet
    workshop" in talking about refurbishing the S-IVB in orbit and using
    it as a laboratory. The idea lacked programmatic approval or support
    until early August, when George Mueller announced the organization
    within Headquarters of an Apollo Applications Program Office to
    extend use of the hardware developed for Apollo-Saturn. Late in
    August, as part of Marshall's contributions to the Apollo
    Applications Program (AAP), a full-fledged design study was initiated
    to examine the concept of the spent stage laboratory and to come to
    some conclusions about its potential. On 1 December 1965, George
    Mueller gave the go-ahead for what was now called the orbital
    workshop, with MSFC as the lead center in the project.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The overall AAP, including the orbital
    workshop concept, originally contemplated a large number of both
    Saturn IB and Saturn V vehicles. In 1966, one early planning schedule
    called for 26 IB launches (primarily to carry three-man crews), and
    19 Saturn V launches. Three S-IVB spent stages, three Saturn V
    workshops, and four Apollo telescope mounts
    [<A NAME="383"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">383</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] were to be orbited. Included in this ambitious
    schedule were five more lunar missions and two synchronous-orbit
    missions. The S-IVB spent stage would be converted to a lab by use of
    the spent-stage experiment support modules. Mounted on the forward
    end of the S-IVB, this module was a docking facility and airlock for
    the Apollo command and service modules. Because the S-IVB lacked crew
    quarters, the crew would live and conduct biomedical experiments in
    the command module, while the empty S-IVB would provide a suitable
    environment for familiarization with zero-g conditions in a
    comparatively large enclosed environment in
    space.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#13.1">1</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By December 1966, plans called for a "wet"
    workshop, created by purging and then pressurizing the hydrogen tank
    in orbit to create a working environment inside. A significant
    addition to the scheme was an Apollo telescope mount, to be carried
    into orbit by another Saturn IB and connected to the orbiting
    workshop. Between 1967 and 1969, the plans for the workshop concept
    shifted with budgetary constraints and available hardware. Finally,
    in July 1969, Administrator Paine announced that the "wet" workshop
    was being dropped in favor of a "dry" workshop. Under this new
    approach, the workshop and the Apollo telescope mount were to be
    launched together by using the first two stages of the Saturn V
    (instead of an uprated Saturn I). All equipment, expendables, and
    experiments would be installed ahead of time in the workshop, ready
    for use when the astronaut crews made their rendezvous and docked. In
    August 1969, McDonnell Douglas became the contractor for two Saturn V
    workshops. The first workshop was scheduled for launch into a low
    Earth orbit sometime in 1972, with the second version serving as a
    backup.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Early in 1970, NASA Headquarters announced
    that the AAP would henceforth be called the Skylab Program. In
    addition MSFC announced that the Saturn IB, carrying the three Skylab
    astronauts, would be launched from the modified Launch Complex 39B at
    Cape Kennedy. The Skylab Program at this time called for launch of
    the Skylab from LC 39A, followed the next day by a Saturn IB launch
    carrying the astronauts. The first crew was programmed to spend 28
    days in orbit, and within the next six months, two more manned
    missions would put three-man crews into the Skylab for approximately
    56 days apiece. Following these missions, Skylab would then be put
    into a storage mode, remaining in orbit.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Developmental and technical problems created a
    delay in the anticipated launch date, which was finally rescheduled
    for the spring of 1973. Meanwhile the Saturn IB first stage for the
    first manned Skylab launch vehicle was taken out of an
    environmentally controlled enclosure at the Michoud Assembly
    Facility, where the stage had been in hibernation for three years.
    This particular booster was one of nine such Saturn IB stages stored
    at Michoud in December 1968. Altogether, four Saturn IB stages were
    designated for the Skylab project: AS-206, AS-207, AS-208, and
    [<A NAME="384"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">384</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] AS-209. Refurbishment of each vehicle was estimated
    at approximately 10 months. The AS-209 vehicle served as the backup
    stage, in case a possible rescue mission needed to be dispatched to
    the Skylab in orbit, using a modified CSM to return five
    astronauts.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#13.4">4</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On 14 May 1973, the Skylab went into orbit
    aboard the AS-513 booster. Skylab was a fairly roomy space station,
    about as large as a medium-sized two-bedroom house, and provided a
    true "shirt-sleeve" environment for the astronaut crew, permitting
    them to live and work inside the Skylab without cumbersome space
    suits. NASA technicians soon realized, however, that something had
    gone very wrong. During the launch, a protective micrometeoroid and
    heat shield was torn loose, and one of the two solar power arrays, to
    provide electrical power to the Skylab, was also ripped away. The
    remaining solar wing was only partly deployed, and lack of power
    allowed the temperatures inside the Skylab to soar. A crash program
    by NASA and contractor technicians came up with a possible solution
    in the form of a large parasol device to deflect the sun's rays and
    reduce interior heat. With special equipment to set up the parasol
    and cut away the debris to free the solar wing, the first Skylab crew
    took off much later than originally planned, on 25 May 1973.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After docking, deployment of the sunshade cut
    the high temperatures inside Skylab, allowing the crew to move in.
    Still, because of the jammed solar panel, problems of temperature
    control and inadequate power persisted. Working outside the Skylab
    and using the tools brought along for this specific task, astronauts
    Charles Conrad, Jr., and Joseph Kerwin finally freed the power panel.
    The makeshift shade, plus partially restored power, reduced interior
    temperatures to comfortable levels, and the mission proceeded. The
    three-man crew spent a month in space, after adjusting to early
    discomfort from extended weightlessness. On their return, physicians
    endorsed ambitious plans for the two succeeding crews to stay up from
    two to three months. The second Skylab crew, launched on 18 July
    1973, spent 59 days in orbit; the third crew, launched 16 November
    1973, spent a record-breaking 84 consecutive days in space before
    splashdown on 8 February 1974. One of the major contributions of the
    Skylab program was convincing proof that crews could indeed spend
    extended period in weightlessness, perform effectively, and suffer no
    harmful effects on return.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to these invaluable biomedical
    records and results, the Skylab crews conducted a wide variety of
    sophisticated experiments on the characteristics of the Earth's
    environment and resources, collected data on the sun and the solar
    system, and experimented with possible types of esoteric industrial
    processes that could be enhanced by performing them in the
    environment of space, avoiding the perturbing factors of the Earth's
    rotation and effect of gravity. Some of the more significant
    astronautical work during the Skylab missions involved extended
    observations of an unusual period of solar flare activity in 1973.

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The last Saturn vehicle to be launched was
    AS-210, on 15 July 1975. Although the Saturns were originally
    developed in response to what was seen as intense Soviet competition
    for domination in space, the last flight of a Saturn launch vehicle
    featured a cooperative mission with the Soviets in space. This was
    the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). The mission involved the
    joining, in Earth orbit, of spacecraft of the United States and the
    Soviet Union. Following many months of preliminary talks and
    agreements, in May 1972 the Russians and Americans agreed to work out
    a common docking system for future generations of spacecraft, leading
    to the ASTP mission. The mission marked the first time that manned
    spacecraft of different nations met in space for cooperative
    engineering and scientific activities.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The ASTP launch vehicle's first stage had been
    built by the Chrysler Corporation at Michoud Assembly Facility in
    January 1967. Following static-firing tests in the spring of 1967,
    the stage was put in storage at Michoud, where it remained until
    October 1972. After the first stage was
    [<A NAME="386"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">386</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] modified, refurbished, and checked out, it was
    shipped to KSC in April 1974. After more months of storage, the first
    and second stages were stacked, and the vehicle was placed on the
    mobile launcher in January 1975. The S-IVB second stage was of the
    same vintage, completed in 1967 by McDonnell Douglas at Huntington
    Beach, California, and was stored there until the fall of 1972, when
    it was shipped to the Kennedy Space Center. The instrument unit,
    built by IBM, shared a similar manufacturing and storage history. It
    was shipped to KSC by barge in May 1974. After stacking, the entire
    vehicle was rolled out to the launch pad late in March 1975;
    continuous preflight checkouts and monitoring of the launch vehicle
    were made until launch that summer.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#13.6">6</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Russians were also preparing their launch
    vehicle and spacecraft. Considerable exchange of technical
    information was required between Soviet and American mission
    personnel. Most of these contacts concerned spacecraft, docking,
    telemetry, and crewmen. Even with the insights gained into Russian
    astronautical technology acquired as a result of the ASTP
    collaboration, public knowledge of Soviet launch vehicles is still
    sketchy in many details. As far as the engines are concerned, the
    Russians apparently based their propulsion systems on technology
    garnered from the V-2s wrested from Germany after World War II. Like
    the Americans, Russian technicians got their early experience in
    launching captured German weapons and then produced a series of
    modified V-2s as they began to develop their own ballistic missile
    technology. Early in the 1950s, the Russians evidently began work on
    a very large propulsion system planned for their first ICBM and
    considered using this propulsion system in space programs as
    well.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although extrapolated from V-2 engine
    technology, this new Soviet engine incorporated a somewhat novel
    arrangement, featuring multiple combustion chambers. The physical
    appearance of the engine, with its quartet of combustion chambers,
    normally creates some confusion in the mind of an observer who
    associates American-style engines with a single turbopump, combustion
    chamber, and exhaust nozzle. In the Russian version, a single
    turbopump fed the oxidizer and fuel to a combination of combustion
    chambers. Thus, while appearing to be a cluster of engines, it is
    actually a cluster of four combustion chambers and exhaust nozzles.
    The Russians designated this propulsion system the RD-107. The RD-107
    burned kerosene-type fuel and liquid oxygen, and the cluster of four
    combustion chambers and exit nozzles produced a total thrust of 1 000
    400 newtons (224 910 pounds). The turbopump was fueled by hydrogen
    peroxide. This engine system did not have a gimbaling capacity, but
    included two small steering rockets. The Soviets produced a variant
    of this engine system known as the RD-108, which differed from its
    cousin only in the fact that it had four small steering rockets
    instead of two.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The combination of these engine systems as a
    single booster powered the series of large Soviet launch vehicles,
    including the Sputnik, and [<A NAME="387"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">387</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] with further
    variations in the upper stages, the Vostok, the Soyuz, and the Salyut
    space station. The basic launch vehicle was known in the United
    States as the type "A" booster, and it was also used by the Russians
    for some unmanned payloads.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The booster design situated the RD- 108 as the
    central core engine, also acting as a sustainer engine. Then four RD-
    107 engines, with long streamlined fairings, were clustered about
    this central core. Integration of the parts of the launch vehicle and
    attaching the payload took place in horizontal position. Still
    horizontal, the entire vehicle was rolled out on a conveyor that
    resembled a railroad flatcar and positioned in the upright launch
    position at the launch pad. The Sputnik booster was a single-stage
    vehicle, although the Vostok, Soyuz, and Salyut vehicles incorporated
    upper stages that apparently used similar liquid oxygen and kerosene
    propellants. In the launch sequence, all the first-stage engines were
    ignited on the pad. The ignition meant a striking liftoff, with 20
    main engine nozzles spouting flame, accompanied by the exhaust plumes
    of the 12 steering rockets. All 20 main engines continued to function
    during the boost phase. As propellants were depleted in the four
    outboard RD-107 engines, these fell away, leaving the RD-108 (the
    central sustainer unit), which continued to fire. Depending upon the
    nature of the mission programmed for the upper stages, the central
    core then separated from the upper-stage combination late in the
    boost phase, and a combination of upper stages put the payload into
    orbit or a space trajectory. The Russian launch vehicle, with its
    four elongated RD-107 streamlined units, looked rather graceful, more
    like a Buck-Rogers-type rocket than some of the American
    boosters.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#13.7">7</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In retrospect, these Russian launch vehicles
    of the A series appear to somewhat less sophisticated than their
    American counterparts, but no less effective in getting heavy
    payloads into orbit. As ex-Soviet engineer and editor Leonid
    Vladimirov pointed out, the RD-107 system took up more space than a
    comparable single-chamber engine of the same power. This meant that
    the diameter of the first stage of the launch vehicle was also
    larger, resulting in a considerably greater launch weight. For this
    reason, the jettison of the four outboard engine systems, leaving the
    sustainer to carry the vehicle into orbit, was an important design
    feature of the Russian launch vehicles. "It was, of course, a very
    complicated, costly and clumsy solution of the problem," Vladimirov
    admitted. "But it was a solution nonetheless; all launchings of
    Soviet manned spacecraft and all the space-shots to Venus and Mars
    have been carried out with the aid of this monstrous twenty-engined
    cluster."</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There were other interesting variations in
    U.S. and Soviet booster technology. The tank skins and structural
    elements of American vehicles kept at minimum thicknesses, shaving
    the weight of the structure as much as possible to enhance the
    payload capability. The first Western insight into the style of
    Soviet vehicle structure occurred in 1967, when

    display in Paris. The Russians series of A-type vehicles appear to
    have been exceedingly heavy. The Vostok launch vehicle arrived via
    Rouen, France, by sea, prior to shipment to Paris. To move the tank
    sections of the launch vehicle, workers hooked up cables to the
    opposite ends of the tank sections and picked them up empty,
    surprising many Western onlookers who expected them to buckle in the
    middle. Their amazement was compounded when the Soviet technicians
    proceeded to walk the length of these tank sections, still suspended
    in mid-air, without damaging them in the least. The Russian vehicles
    were, if anything, extremely rugged. The launching weight of the
    Vostok and spacecraft is still a matter of conjecture because the
    Soviets have not released specific numbers. Vladimirov estimated
    around 400 metric tons on the ground, with the greater part of the
    weight accounted for by the heavy engines. He drew an interesting
    comparison between the Soviet type A vehicle and the American launch
    vehicle known as the Titan:</FONT></P>

    launch vehicle with the capability of the Saturn V, they apparently
    attempted to do so. Rumors of this new vehicle, known as type G,
    gained currency following a space conference in Spain in 1966. Rather
    than develop new, exotic high-energy propellants and propulsion
    systems, Soviet designers reportedly used engines from advanced ICBMs
    and clustered a large number of chambers to achieve high thrust. The
    type G booster was rolled out during the summer of 1969, but during a
    static test, a leak evidently began in one of the upper stages,
    developed into a fire, and destroyed the entire vehicle. The
    disastrous fire also wiped out the launch facility, including
    underground equipment complexes as well service towers and other
    support equipment at the launch site. Reports indicate that a type G
    vehicle was launched in midsummer of 1971, but the rocket broke up
    and disintegrated before reaching orbit. In November 1972, the
    Russians made one more attempt to launch the big type G rocket. Bad
    luck continued to plague the effort, and the 1972 mission also ended
    in disaster, apparently because of a failure in the first stage. As
    1975 came to a close, development of the type G seemed to be in a
    state of limbo.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    in the 1960s and early 1970s had an obvious impact in the south and

    influence in the region stretched along a great arc, from the Manned
    Spacecraft Center in Texas, to Marshall Space Flight Center in
    Alabama, to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. In between were MSFC's

    concentration of space-related expertise and activities has been
    described as "a fertile crescent" of astronautical skills.
    Development of these centers of major NASA activities created

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Before the von Braun team came to Huntsville,
    Alabama, the town was known as "Water Cress Capital of the World."
    Its population was 16 000. Even so, this period of Huntsville's
    "salad days" continued strong ties with the cotton textile industry,
    and Huntsville once boasted 13 cotton mills in the area. Throughout
    the 1940s, the other major source of employment in the area had been
    the Redstone Arsenal. Established in 1941, the 1620-square-kilometer
    arsenal was used by the U.S. Army in the production and testing of
    chemical warfare weapons. After the war, it was shut down, declared
    surplus property, and put up for sale in 1949. Huntsville city
    fathers and local politicians, including Senator John Sparkman and
    Representative Bob Jones, were soon sounding out their contacts in
    the Department of Defense to see what could be done to keep the
    Arsenal alive. Jones and Sparkman were hot on the trail of a new
    location for wind tunnel test facilities for the Air Force, but lost
    out to the state of Tennessee. The wind tunnel was located at the
    recently closed Camp Forest at Tullahoma, and was eventually named
    the Arnold Engineering Development Center. Nevertheless, Sparkman and
    Jones had made an impression. Secretary of the Air Force Stuart
    Symington told Sparkman that Alabama would get something better in
    the long run. A few weeks later, the Alabama congressmen found out
    exactly what they [<A NAME="391"></A></FONT><B><FONT

    under consideration. The site selection committee included von Braun,
    and he was enthusiastic about Huntsville from the beginning. "For me,
    it was love at first sight," he said. Among other things, the
    advantages of Huntsville included the existing Arsenal facilities,
    abundant low-cost electric power from the TVA, the Tennessee River
    (both for water supply and transportation), and the open space. "In
    selecting this site, of course," von Braun recalled, "in our field we
    had to consider that these rockets would be making a lot of
    noise."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> After the arrival of the Army's missile agency in
    April 1950, Huntsville started its meteoric growth, from 16 000 in
    1950 to 48 000 enumerated in a special census held in 1956. The 1960
    census put the population of the city at 72 000; another special
    census in 1964 gave the population as 123 000; in 1970 it was 136
    102. Construction boomed during the first half of the 1960s: the city
    of Huntsville was 195th in population in the United States, but
    ranked 25th in building construction.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1950, the city limits extended about one
    and a half kilometers from each side of the courthouse, encompassing
    11.1 square kilometers, with roughly 125 kilometers of sewer lines
    but no sewage treatment plant at all. Huntsville's effluent was piped
    to a creek outside the city limits, where it was carried directly
    into the Tennessee River. Tax considerations and other agreements
    made earlier with the textile mills provided a stumbling block to
    city plans for enlarging the city limits, along with improving sewage
    facilities-which the Army was now insisting on. After numerous
    sessions lasting into the early hours of the morning, representatives
    from the city, the Army, and the mills came to an agreement, and in
    1956 the city of Huntsville suddenly enlarged itself to over 181
    square kilometers. Eventually, over 1300 kilometers of sanitary lines
    and a first-rate sanitation system served the
    area.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The influx of Army personnel, NASA civil
    servants, and contractors, with their families, raised enrollments in
    the city schools from 3000 in 1950 to over 33 000 by 1974. The
    numbers barely suggest the problems involved in establishing
    classrooms, finding teachers, and creating appropriate curricula.
    Fortunately, among the families of the scientists, engineers, and
    technicians pouring into the city were spouses with teaching
    backgrounds to help staff the expanding school system. The schools
    developed a definite scientific-technological bent, probably
    encouraged by the frequent appearance of many of Marshall's top
    personnel as guests and speakers in school classrooms and assemblies.
    Huntsville's new population also gave the public schools a strong
    orientation to higher education, with 80-95 percent of Huntsville's
    high school students going on to college, in comparison to a state
    average of only 20 [<A NAME="392"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">392</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] percent. Rapid
    population growth also brought new challenges to Huntsville's medical
    facilities. The Huntsville Hospital had been built in the 1920s. By
    the early 1950s, patients were being placed in the hallways of the
    hospital, and an emergency expansion finally brought the hospital's
    capacity to 150 beds. Severe pressures for medical services
    persisted, and by 1970, Huntsville had four hospitals in operation
    with a total of almost 1000 beds.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There was a parallel impact on higher
    education in the city. Since 1949, the Chamber of Commerce had been
    advocating a branch of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. A
    center was authorized, and 139 part-time students began classes in
    January 1950. The arrival of von Braun and the elaboration of Army
    research immediately stimulated a graduate program. In 1960,
    construction of a permanent campus began at the northern edge of the
    city, and von Braun appeared before the Alabama legislature in
    support of an appeal for a $3-million bond issue to establish a
    research institute geared to graduate research at the new campus. The
    bond request was passed easily by the legislature and approved
    quickly by the voters, a success marking a sustained period of growth
    by the University of Alabama in Huntsville, with a student body of
    over 4000 and a replacement value of about $30 million by
    1974.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The citizens of Huntsville always maintained a
    strong interest in cultural activities, with literary and music
    societies dating back several generations. The arrival of the
    culturally minded German rocketeers enhanced this tradition and left
    an imprint on the history of the arts in Huntsville. According to
    local legend, the Germans arriving in Huntsville equipped themselves
    with library cards even before the water in their homes had been
    turned on. The newcomers from Fort Bliss not only appeared in public
    school classrooms, giving informal lectures and talks, but were
    regular attendees at local PTA meetings. Acculturation was remarkably
    rapid. Three years after arriving in Huntsville, the DAR medal for
    the best American history student in the city went to a young German
    girl.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Wanting to avoid a German enclave in the
    middle of the dry, von Braun encouraged his associates to settle all
    over Huntsville. The rocket engineers and the Huntsville natives soon
    established strong bonds of common interests and activities. A local
    chamber music group learned of the musical inclinations of many of
    the newcomers. The day he arrived, Werner Kuers, an accomplished
    violinist, was startled to receive a call to join one of the local
    music groups in need of a new violin. "I was very astonished," Kuers
    recalled. "Mr. Dreger soon started to arrange playing sessions for us
    in homes and churches. We were introduced into quite a number of very
    friendly families interested in cultural activities and education. I
    experienced a welcome in this city that I had never experienced

    Peenemuende and of Fort Bliss were quickly absorbed into the life of
    Huntsville and into American culture. In April 1955, only five years
    after they had arrived in Alabama, the first group of 109 Germans
    became American citizens. Their naturalization took place at a public
    ceremony in the Huntsville High School auditorium, part of the
    officially proclaimed events of a "New Citizens' Day" declared by the
    city. Many of the newly naturalized American citizens had already
    taken an active role in civic affairs. A sergeant in the Luftwaffe
    when he was assigned to Peenemuende, Walter Wiesman joined the Junior
    Chamber of Commerce in Huntsville soon after the von Braun team's
    arrival in 1950. Two years later-before Wiesman became a naturalized

    sometimes referred to Huntsville as "Peenemuende South." For years,
    the city proudly called itself Rocket City, U.S.A. Nevertheless, the
    city fathers, as well as von Braun himself, realized that federal
    budgets, like NASA's, had valleys as well as crests. It was widely
    agreed that Huntsville should expend considerable time and energy
    attracting other industries into the area. In later years, von Braun
    took a considerable measure of satisfaction in remembering his role
    as an advocate of diversification. "I can say in retrospect that I
    have never regretted using my powers of persuasion... in talks with
    the city fathers and our community advisory committee, when I always
    reminded people: `Don't get too used to this NASA money that's
    flowing into this area.'" He warned against becoming a
    single-business town and advocated the attraction of other industries
    during a period of good stability, with attention to nonaerospace
    companies in particular.</FONT></P>

    Redstone Arsenal. The continuing development of the Cummings Research
    Park characterized this high-level technology. Located near the
    University of Alabama campus, the Research Park comprised over 30
    companies that offered unique management services and research
    facilities and employed over 6000 people with an annual payroll of
    over $93 million by 1974. In the 1960s, the emphasis was on space,
    but the farsightedness of von Braun and other Huntsville industrial
    executives maintained a healthy diversity in the city's manufacturing
    companies in the 1970s. At the Research Park and elsewhere, including
    an industrial center located near the new Jetport, Huntsville's
    products included automobile radios, digital clocks, electronic
    parts, computers, TV cameras, ax handles, flags, aircraft specialty
    glass, tools and dies, telephones, rubber tires, and a host of other

    as Big Spring Park. A $14- million complex that opened in 1975, the
    center included a large arena, as well as a spacious exhibit hall. A
    concert hall and playhouse provided exceptionally fine facilities for
    both performers and audience. Finally, the performing arts in
    Huntsville were no longer dependent upon the good will of various
    churches and high school auditoriums. The homeless graphic arts of
    the city at last found, in the Von Braun Center, a handsome new
    creative arts museum, with arrangements for both permanent and
    visiting art exhibits. The city also acquired a major tourist
    attraction, the Alabama Space and Rocket center. The Center not only
    coordinated tours at MSFC, but also mounted some innovative displays.
    Skillfully planned and automated dioramas and indoor exhibits
    explained the theory of the solar system, fundamentals of rocket
    propulsion, future space exploration, and numerous other aspects of

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless the technology represented by the
    electronics and computer industries has benefited from the space
    program essentially in terms of second order consequences. Much of
    that technology and many of the techniques were developed for highly
    sophisticated and complex space programs and only with some changing
    and adaptation were the technology and techniques found to be
    suitable for other civilian applications. This factor is an example
    of what Bauer and others have called the "intangible spinoff."
    Further, advances in this respect are important to
    [<A NAME="396"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">396</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] technology for a couple of reasons. Taken
    individually, these incremental improvements contribute to overall
    efficiency and often to higher quality in day-to-day industrial
    operations in the production of goods and services. As Bauer
    emphasized, "Although the gain from application of a new welding
    technique may be small, the aggregate benefits of many such advances,
    applied in many industries and firms, can be quite large." In
    addition, Bauer emphasized it was possible for new methods, new
    advances, and new ideas to come together in some combination that
    would also result in a striking or significant new advance. "The
    convergence of a number of such improvements, along with technical
    advances arising in other fields, may make possible new fundamental
    inventions of substantial individual
    significance."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#13.22">22</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the development of the Saturn vehicle, many
    spinoffs consisted of myriad improvements in the prosaic areas of
    shop work, although such improvements were usually the result of new
    fabrication technologies and use of advanced materials. William R.
    Lucas, a senior engineer at MSFC and later Director of the Marshall
    Space Flight Center, emphasized that the almost immediate usage of
    new aluminum alloys at MSFC undoubtedly encouraged further research
    and development in the field, including the development of additional
    alloys, thermal treatment, and fabrication processes. By the same
    token, new research and development work in the welding of aluminum
    alloys also took place.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> Consistent with Bauer's comments about the
    significance of the accretion of technological expertise as well as
    the potential impact of convergence, one welding engineer at Marshall
    Space Flight Center posed this rhetorical question: "What has the
    space program contributed to welding technology?" The engineer
    admitted that the question was at once blunt as well as
    disconcerting-disconcerting, "because many of the contributions are
    quite subtle, beyond the reach of symbolism, and often never
    recognized."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#13.24">24</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Marshall's successful approach to welding
    problems was not so much a function of breathtaking or striking
    breakthroughs as it was a process of accretion and convergence: the
    application of improved techniques, thoughtful readjustment and
    realignment of certain modes of the operation as well as the
    equipment, taking a slightly different approach in the operational
    techniques for welding different alloys, and an increasing concern
    for absolute cleanliness. At Marshall Space Flight Center, a familiar
    statement was that "the weld may be defined as a continuous defect
    surrounded by parent metal." The high incidence of weld defects and
    high repair rates, even as late as 1967, was a continuing problem.
    One of the most frequent defects involved porosity. R. B. Hoppes
    described the situation in 1967: "In 144,000 inches [366 000
    centimeters] of weld made on four Saturn V first stages, porosity
    accounted for 79% of the total number of defects. Cracks ranked
    second at 9%." The nagging problems were solved basically by the
    application of [<A NAME="397"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">397</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] some of the
    techniques and procedures outlined above, particularly cleanliness.
    Contaminants created most of the porosity problems, and Marshall
    engineers went back almost step by step through the welding process,
    rethinking their approach, and taking special care to eliminate any
    instance where contaminants might come into contact with the surfaces
    to be welded. It was only by this careful and conservative approach,
    rather than through some marvelous breakthrough, that the welding
    problems were finally surmounted.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#13.25">25</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Marshall's experience in solving welding
    problems, along with similar information from other NASA programs,
    was disseminated through a series of special publications by the NASA
    Technology Utilization program. Fourteen published studies, for
    example, were sponsored by MSFC through the Battelle Memorial
    Institute of Columbus, Ohio. The studies described the problems of
    weld porosity and defects and the various steps in welding the
    large-scale components that were part of the Saturn V development
    program.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> Other NASA pamphlets resulting from the Apollo-Saturn
    program dealt with brazing and brazing alloys, piping and tubing,
    seals and sealing, insulation tools and techniques, a technique for
    joining and sealing dissimilar metals, and the application of
    magnesium lithium alloys. The electromagnetic hammer developed in the
    S-IC manufacturing program was used by a number of aircraft and other
    metal-working firms, and the contributions of the Saturn program to
    general technology included a publication on advanced bearing
    designs. The commonplace, but highly useful, parade of developments
    and contributions ran the gamut from better adhesives for bonding
    auto trim to several different kinds of computer programming, to
    spray foam, to new types of pipe, and better ways of doing things in
    a wide variety of fields.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There were numerous instances of new
    technological developments, some among the Saturn contractors, others
    involving both government and industry. The difficulties of Douglas
    in trying to find a good substitute for balsa wood in the S-IV and
    S-IVB stages is an example. North American took the lead in
    perfecting spray-foam insulation for the S-II second stage, including
    the special phenolic cutters to trim the stuff once it had cured. On
    the other hand, it is virtually impossible to pinpoint all the major
    technological innovations in Saturn, then ascribe them to personnel
    at Marshall or at some contractor's plant. Marshal set the
    specifications and guidelines, and the contractor produced the
    product. MSFC followed its contractors very closely, not only in
    paperwork, but also in hardware. Laboratories and test stands at
    Huntsville were not just backup facilities, they provided depth and
    additional manpower for problems encountered in a joint program. Thus
    the F-1 combustion [<A NAME="398"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">398</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] instability problem
    was simultaneously tackled from several angles by both NASA and
    Rocketdyne. The Saturn program succeeded because complications were
    faced and resolved; the mutual goal was to make the vehicles work,
    and they did.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The whole field of cryogenics changed as a
    result of the Saturn program, with government and industry
    cooperating on a number of problems. For one thing, there was the
    sheer volume of production of cryogenic materials, storage,
    transportation, and many technical problems of piping it from one
    point to another at test sites and at the launch pad. Computer
    operations and related software were affected by the influence of
    Saturn requirements for test, checkout, and launch, which led, among
    other things, to the new computer language called ATOLL (Acceptance
    Test or Launch Language). Demands for unparalleled compactness and
    reliability in Saturn guidance and control resulted in instrument
    unit innovations such as unit logic devices and triple modular
    redundancy. As a part of the effort to keep weight at the minimum,
    guidance and control components in the instrument unit were
    fabricated from beryllium and magnesium-lithium alloys, the first
    application of these materials, which are difficult to work with, in
    the space program.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The unusually large dimensions of Saturn
    components posed recurrent complications. In developing the S-IC
    stage, production of the large skin panels depended on refinement of
    existing techniques of metals fabrication and forming, but even more
    in the manner and utilization of oversized tooling never accomplished
    before. In fact, in dealing with the technology of the Saturns in
    general, the most consistent factor seemed to be the enormous size of
    the vehicles. Time after time, when engineers and technicians were
    pressed to define what was "new" about the Saturn, what fantastic new
    technological techniques were applied in its development, personnel
    would shake their heads and invariably comment on
    size.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#13.28">28</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> Size was a factor in tooling as well as in welding
    exotic space-age alloys, especially in the case of the S-II stage.
    Even though every attempt was made to use off-the-shelf hardware and
    existing technology, Saturn's size implied new requirements and new
    complications. It just was not possible, for example, to take an H-1
    engine and easily uprate it to the thrust of an F-1 engine. The
    extrapolation of existing technology simply did not work when the
    engines got into the operational regimes of higher flow rates,
    pressures, and the associated wear and tear on the engine
    machinery.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Saturn logistics generated unexpected
    difficulties. Prior to the Saturn program, rockets could be moved
    from factory to test site to launch pad by conventional means, such
    as available highway, water, or air transport. Saturn used these
    transport modes as well, but required oversized equipment,
    custom-built or modified for the job.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In terms of management, NASA seems to have
    borrowed, albeit with permutations, bits and pieces of managerial
    techniques from industry, [<A NAME="399"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">399</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] business, and the
    military. What NASA (and particularly Marshall Space Flight Center)
    apparently added was "visibility," in terms of progress and problems,
    as well as of the individual responsible for handling these aspects.
    Visibility, both for the product and for personnel, was the prime
    concern of the Program Control Center of Arthur Rudolph's Saturn V
    Program Office. Its success in tracking the myriad bits and pieces of
    Saturn vehicles impressed even NASA Administrator Webb, who prided
    himself on managerial techniques and skills. Claiming that MSFC was
    unusually thorough in its management may seem like a simplification.
    Given the diversity of the prime contractors and their armies of
    subcontractors and vendors, however, the clockwork efficiency and the
    reliability of the Saturn vehicles were remarkable. Meticulous
    attention to details, and keeping track of them, was a hallmark of
    MSFC.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It is worth noting that even after the Saturn
    V program was over, MSFC still received many requests from businesses
    and managers asking "how did you do it?" Here again it is probably
    wise to remember Bauer's admonition that space management, just like
    space hardware, has been frequently developed to meet particular and
    complex problems, not always compatible with the outside, or
    commercial, world.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In retrospect it seems that the impact of the
    Saturn program, in terms of spinoff, was best observed in improved
    industrial technique, in basic shop practices, and in the frequently
    prosaic but necessary areas of how to run machine tools, how to bend
    tubes, how to make and apply fasteners, and simply how to get around
    in a machine shop. This was part of Marshall's heritage anyhow. It
    must be remembered that the von Braun team came directly out of the
    Army tradition of the in-house arsenal philosophy, and that Marshall
    not only built the first of the Saturn I vehicles, but the first few
    S-IC first stages as well. Even though they did not get into the
    construction of S-II, S-IV, and S-IVB stages and their engines,
    Marshall consistently retained the in-house capability of duplicating
    test programs and even major parts of such hardware. As Lee James
    noted, it was difficult to make this kind of concept acceptable, and
    work effectively with the contractor. Marshall somehow carried it
    off.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Apollo-Saturn program frequently used the
    overworked phrase, "government-industry team" in explaining how the
    Saturn program was carried out successfully. It would be easy to
    underestimate this phrase as a, bit of public relations flak put out
    by the space centers as well as the manufacturers themselves. Such
    does not seem to be the case. It was not unusual, in the course of
    interviews with contractor and NASA personnel, to name someone who
    had been interviewed previously on a related topic. The mention would
    bring about a quick smile and a brightening of the eyes and a
    response like "Oh, do you know so and so? Yes, we worked
    on....followed by one or two anecdotes indicating a feeling of
    exceedingly strong partnership. Government and contractor personnel
    actually did relate to each other, especially at the technical
    levels. This ingredient [<A NAME="400"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">400</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] had to be important
    to the success of the program. It meant that individuals could easily
    call each other on the phone, discuss a problem, agree on a solution,
    and continue the work without major interruption.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The overall success of the Saturn program
    depended on a significant number of key decisions. One of these would
    have to be the decision in 1957 to start consideration of the
    clustered engine concept as a means to get heavy payloads into orbit.
    As natural as this concept seems today, it has to be remembered that
    the tricky nature and recalcitrant operating characteristics of
    rocket engines at that time suggested clustering of two or more
    engines would be courting absolute disaster. Next was the decision to
    use liquid hydrogen as one of the propellants. The application of
    this high-energy fuel made all the difference in the performance of
    the Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V vehicles. The use of the fuel
    allowed optimum sizing of the stages while keeping the weight to a
    minimum, so that a three-astronaut payload could be carried
    successfully into orbit and boosted into lunar trajectory. The
    controversy of EOR-LOR also stands out as a major period of decision
    early in the program. The choice of LOR led to the successful Saturn
    IB interim vehicle and stabilized the design configuration of the
    Saturn V. Finally, the decision to adopt the all-up concept stands
    out as one of the steps that permitted the United States to achieve
    the manned lunar landing on the moon before the end of the
    1960s.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It is interesting to note that the von Braun
    team argued about the acceptance of three of these four major program
    milestones. On the other hand, the argument seems to have been one of
    degree rather than one of substance. Despite the strong recollections
    of individuals who say that von Braun opposed liquid hydrogen from
    the beginning, one must remember that LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> had been included
    very early by MFSC-in terms of the Centaur upper stage-in some of the
    early Saturn system studies.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The collective technological experience of the
    Saturn program was effectively applied in planning the Shuttle
    program, most notably in the Shuttle's propellant and propulsion
    systems. Marshall's experience in the handling and pumping of
    cryogenics, construction of fuel tanks, and development of the
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    engines were directly applied to the Shuttle
    concept.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#13.29">29</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In one respect, the technology of the Saturn
    vehicle represented the closing of a circle in international space
    partnership and cooperation. Allies in World War II, the U.S. and the
    U.S.S.R. both borrowed heavily from the technological storehouse of
    their defeated foe, Germany. In the early postwar years, both the
    U.S. and the U.S.S.R. learned from firing their respective stocks of
    captured V-2 rockets and perfected significant sectors of their own
    new rocket technology out of the V-2 experience common to both. This
    propulsion technology was further elaborated during the Cold War era
    along an escalating front of improved ICBM weaponry. When landing on
    the moon became an acknowledged race,
    [<A NAME="401"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">401</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] both borrowed liberally from the extant technology of
    ICBM propulsion systems to build large rocket boosters. Tempered in
    wars both hot and cold, the technological heritage of the launch
    vehicles that put the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project into orbit could be
    traced back to the German technicians of World War II. The former
    wartime allies were now closing a technological circle that had
    ranged from partners, to protagonists, to partners again, with German
    expertise in rocketry as a catalyst.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Partnership in space, by itself, will be no
    automatic guarantee of international amity. Partnership in space
    exploration may be an exhilarating prospect, however, offering an
    additional incentive for international cooperation and peace. If so,
    then the Saturn program may count this factor as its most important
    legacy.</FONT></P>
