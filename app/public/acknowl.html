    FACE="Geneva">xix</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Dr. Rudolph
    Hermann, Director of the Research Institute of the University of
    Alabama at Huntsville (UAH), encouraged much of the early work of the
    Saturn history project. His successor, Dr. John F. Porter, Jr., and
    Dr. J. Edwin Rush, Director of Graduate Programs and research at UAH,
    provided continuing encouragement and support.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Frederick I. Ordway III and David L.
    Christensen were primarily responsible for acquiring specialized
    documentation under the UAH contract. With unusual accuracy and
    efficiency, Mrs. M.L. Childress helped set up the documentary files
    and their annotated index and typed several early drafts of the
    history. John Stuart Beltz, one of the original historians on the
    project, drafted several "working papers" on aspects of the Saturn
    program that were helpful in preparing the final manuscript. Beltz
    conducted several interviews and acquired contractor documentation,
    particularly concerning the S-II stage of the Saturn V. Many long
    conversations with him helped shape this and other parts of the
    Saturn narrative. Mitchell R. Sharpe of George C. Marshall Space
    Flight Center developed working papers and bibliographies on early
    rocket history and assisted in acquiring materials on Saturn
    management (</FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="ch9.htm">chapter
    9</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">) and the "all-up" launch of the
    first Saturn V (</FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="ch12.htm">chapter
    12</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the MSFC Historical Office, David S. Akens,
    Leo L. Jones, and A. Ruth Jarrell offered continuous assistance.
    After the office was abolished, Robert G. Sheppard, Don Lakey, and
    Betty Davis helped fill requests for additional information and
    coordinated the distribution of preliminary copies of the manuscript
    within MSFC for editorial comment. Bonnie Holmes, in the MSFC
    Director's Office, provided invaluable help during a follow-up
    research visit to MSFC during the summer of 1975 and helped acquire
    photographs and drawings.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the final phases of completing the
    manuscript, the documents of the Saturn history project were
    temporarily transferred to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) near the
    University of Houston/Clear Lake City (UH/CLC) campus. James M.
    Grimwood, JSC Historian, not only [<A NAME="xx"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">xx</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] provided shelf space
    for these documents but also provided office facilities, access to
    the coffee pot, encouragement, and advice. My debt to him is
    considerable. I wish to thank Sally Gates and my other colleagues,
    also of JSC, at work on NASA histories; Edward and Linda Ezell and
    David Compton, whose interest and suggestions were unfailingly
    helpful. At UH/CLC, Dr. Calvin Cannon, Dean of Human Sciences and
    Humanities, and Dr. Peter Fischer, Director of Programs in
    Humanities, generously cooperated in arranging teaching duties to
    benefit research and writing. Special thanks go to Jean Sherwood and
    Myra Hewitt Young who worked so cheerfully and conscientiously in
    typing the manuscript.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Dr. Eugene M. Emme, of the History Office at
    NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., organized and guided the NASA
    historical program and monitored the Apollo-Saturn history effort.
    Lee Saegesser, archivist in the History Office, invariably turned up
    needed illustrations and documents. I owe a special debt, however, to
    Dr. Monte D. Wright, Directory of the History Office, and Dr. Frank
    W. Anderson, Jr., Publications Manager, for their painstaking and
    thorough editing of early drafts of the manuscript. I learned much
    from their criticisms, and the manuscript, I trust, is much the
    better for their close attention to it. I would like to emphasize
    here that I have had complete freedom in interpreting the Saturn
    program in my own way. I was only cautioned at one point
    </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">not</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> to
    write in such a way to open myself to the charge of delivering a
    "company history."</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Personnel from NASA and contractors' offices
    all over the United States diligently and graciously responded to
    requests for additional illustrations and documentation. Dozens of
    NASA and contractor personnel (the majority of whom still remain
    unknown to me) read various drafts of the manuscript and returned
    copies with suggestions and corrections. Since I cannot possibly
    identify and list all of them, I can only acknowledge my great
    obligation to their interest in this history of Saturn. Likewise, I
    want to acknowledge the cooperation extended by the dozens of NASA
    and contractor personnel who consented to interviews. As for any
    remaining errors of fact or interpretation, they are mine.</FONT>
