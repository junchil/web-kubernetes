    for the Saturn I and Saturn IB, designed and built for Earth-orbital
    operations, traced their ancestry back to the Juno V. Saturn I and IB
    technology was characterized by the "bargain basement"
    approach-off-the-shelf tankage, and available engines. Saturn V, a
    vehicle designed for lunar voyages, required new engineering
    concepts. Designers for the S-IC and S-II stages tried to follow
    NASA's general guidelines to use proven technology in the big new
    boosters, avoiding problems and delays. Nonetheless, problems
    abounded.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the first place, there was the problem of
    proportions. The S-IC and S-II both were sized to a 10-meter
    diameter. In the fabrication of booster tankage, new tooling of
    unique size and capabilities had to be built, and fabrication of the
    tank cylinders and domes required circumferential welds and meridian
    welds of unprecedented length. For manned flights, the welds also had
    to pass stringent inspection to "man-rate" the Saturn V vehicle. The
    difficulties faced by welding engineers and technicians were
    formidable. In terms of the nearly perfect welds required for the
    man-rated stages, weld passes of several dozen centimeters were
    considered possible (though highly difficult) within the state of the
    art; now, requirements for the S-IC and S-II demanded nearly perfect
    welds of several dozen meters. The task became a maddening cycle of
    "cut-and-try" operations. The long welding runs generated
    unmanageable distortions in large-circumference cylinders. Additional
    difficulties included coping with the varying thickness of pieces
    being joined by the welding pass; quality requirements for the
    integrity of welded seams and alignments of the components created
    still more revisions to operational manuals. Experienced welders had
    to be taught the new techniques through on-the-job instructional
    classes conducted on-site by the contractor.</FONT></P>

    of the S-IC, the Boeing effort got off to a faster start largely
    because of the unusual role played by the Marshall Space Flight
    Center in the early stages of design and fabrication, and the
    availability of existing facilities at MSFC's Huntsville complex and
    at Michoud. The S-II encountered more than its share of problems, for
    a variety of reasons. Use of LH</FONT><SUB><FONT

    stage of this size was unique. There were insulation problems,
    materials and fabrication problems, and, in the opinion of MSFC,

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When the contract to build the biggest stage
    of the Saturn V, the S-IC first stage, was awarded to Boeing on 15
    December 1961, general outlines of the first-stage booster were
    already fairly well delineated. The main configuration of the S-IC
    had already been established by MSFC, including the decision to use
    RP-1, as opposed to the LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> fuel used in the
    upper stages. Although LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> promised greater
    power, some quick figuring indicated that it would not work for the
    first stage booster.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Liquid hydrogen was only one half as dense as
    kerosene. This density ratio indicated that, for the necessary
    propellant, an LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> tank design would require a far larger tank volume
    than required for RP-1. The size would create unacceptable penalties
    in tank weight and aerodynamic design. So, RP-1 became the fuel. In
    addition, because both the fuel and oxidant were relatively dense,
    engineers chose a separate, rather than integral, container
    configuration with a common bulkhead. The leading issue prior to the
    contract awards related to the number of engines the first stage
    would mount.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.1">1</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The C-5 configuration, late in 1960, was
    generally portrayed as a rocket with four F-1 engines in the first
    stage. Not everyone was happy with this approach, particularly Milton
    Rosen at NASA, recently tagged by Brainerd Holmes as the new Director
    of Launch Vehicles and Propulsion in the Office of Manned Space
    Flight. At the direction of Holmes, Rosen organized a special
    committee to hammer out conclusions and configurations on launch
    vehicles (see </FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="ch3.htm">chapter
    3</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">). The group moved into a block of
    motel rooms in Huntsville for an intensive two-week stint, including,
    as Rosen recalled, one marathon stretch of five days of almost
    [<A NAME="193"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">193</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] around-the-clock negotiating. Among other things, the
    committee's report, delivered to Holmes on 20 March 1961, recommended
    five, not four, engines in the first stage.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Rosen apparently took the lead in pressing for
    the fifth engine, consistent with his obstinate push for a "big
    rocket." The MSFC contingent during the meetings included William
    Mrazek, Hans Maus, and James Bramlet. Rosen argued long and hard with
    Mrazek, until Mrazek bought the idea, carried the argument to his
    colleagues, and together they ultimately swayed von Braun. Adding the
    extra power plant really did not call for extensive design changes;
    this was Rosen's most convincing argument. Marshall engineers had
    drawn up the first stage to mount the original four engines at the
    ends of two heavy crossbeams at the base of the rocket. The innate
    conservatism of the von Braun design team was fortunate here, because
    the crossbeams were much heavier than required. Their inherent
    strength meant no real problems in mounting the fifth powerplant at
    the junction of the crossbeams, and the Saturn thus gained the added
    thrust to handle the increasingly heavy payloads of the later Apollo
    missions. "Conservative design," Rosen declared, "saved
    Apollo."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.2">2</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At second glance, MSFC people themselves found
    no good reason not to add the extra engine, especially with the
    payload creeping upward all the time. "I had an awfully uneasy
    feeling, you know," von Braun remembered; "every time we talked to
    the Houston people, the damn LEM [lunar excursion module] had gotten
    heavier again." The added F-1 also relieved some of the concern about
    accumulating exhaust gases, with explosive potential, in the large
    space between the original four engines, and helped solve a
    base-heating problem in much the same way. The physical presence and
    exhaust plume of engine number five filled the void and directed
    gases and heat away from the base of the first stage. At a Management
    Council Meeting on 21 December 1961, NASA formalized the five-engine
    configuration for the S-IC.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.3">3</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the past the Army Ballistic Missile Agency
    (ABMA) had performed its own preliminary design work-and even
    fabrication-on the first stage of launch vehicles. At Marshall the
    designers approached the S-IC somewhat differently. They enlisted
    Boeing's cooperation at a much earlier stage of the game, giving
    increased responsibility to the contractor. After signing the
    contract in December 1961, Boeing engineers worked "elbow-to-elbow"
    with MSFC in finalizing details of the big first stage. It was a
    mutually beneficial environment. With so many other irons in the
    fire, Marshall did not have the manpower to lavish on the S-IC, and
    Boeing got the chance to influence the outlines of the booster it
    would be building later. By the summer of 1962, Boeing had almost 500
    engineers and technicians working on site at MSFC, and another 600
    installed in a sprawling, hastily reconditioned cotton mill in
    downtown Huntsville known as the "HIC Building" (for Huntsville
    Industrial [<A NAME="194"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">194</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Center). Boeing's
    Huntsville operations concentrated on final hardware design and
    continuing liaison with MSFC.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Boeing also had about 450 people at Michoud,
    preparing for manufacturing operations. Michoud was also the
    management focal point for the S-IC, with the Saturn Booster Branch,
    under George H. Stoner, located there. From Michoud, Stoner presided
    over several far-flung elements. In Seattle, the company's home
    office, Boeing personnel carried out engineering and research support
    for Saturn, such as wind tunnel studies and other specialized
    engineering data. At Boeing's Wichita plant, the heavy tooling for
    Michoud was prepared, and subassemblies used in making up the tankage
    and other components of the booster were fabricated.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Michoud itself operated under Richard H.
    Nelson, with four sections for operations, quality and reliability
    assurance, engineering, and booster test. Engineering and
    manufacturing procedures were also laid out and coordinated with
    MSFC, covering a multitude of items, ranging from accidents, to test
    procedures, to the controlled use of precious metals, to "unplanned
    event reports." MSFC received many volumes of company reports, formal
    and informal, regarding the progress and problems of both the S-IC
    stage and the Michoud operations. Annual progress reports to the
    Marshall center summed up company activities. Topics included road
    construction; lighting in conference rooms; electrical troubles in
    the S-IC lifting derricks; and changes in stage design, test stands,
    and production. The company also reported on its special training
    programs for new employees in some of the esoteric arts of welding
    large space vehicles, radiographic inspection, and several varied
    courses in a number of specialized skills for production of booster
    rockets.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.4">4</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This unusually intertwined work between
    government and contractor prompted Stoner at one point to ask von
    Braun, somewhat plaintively, why pick on Boeing? Why not allow the
    company to forge ahead on its own, like Douglas and North American?
    MSFC stemmed from the Redstone Arsenal, and MSFC managers intended to
    maintain an in-house capability. As von Braun once explained,
    contractors might present beautifully turned out pieces of sample
    hardware, expounding the virtues of exotic lightweight alloys and
    advanced welding technology. MSFC remained skeptical. Highly finished
    work on small samples was one thing. What about welding very large,
    oversized segments together where alignment and integrity of weld
    were very tricky to achieve? MSFC wanted to maintain its expertise,
    to make sure that alloys and welds would really work before the
    manufacturer began production. In this respect, Matt Urlaub, MSFC's
    manager for the S-I stage, suggested additional reasons for staying
    close to Boeing. All of Marshall's stage contracts went to companies
    accustomed to working under Air Force jurisdiction, a situation that
    gave the companies considerable latitude in
    [<A NAME="195"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">195</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] technical design, fabrication and manufacturing
    procedures, and day-to-day operations. These companies were also
    principally airframe manufacturers. Marshall felt, however, that it
    had great competence in R&amp;D, building prototypes, and technical
    management in rocketry. Therefore, Marshall should exert considerable
    influence in its areas of expertise early in the game, then let the
    contractors handle the production aspects. Douglas (with the S-IV/IVB
    contract) and North American (the S-II contract) were to manufacture
    their respective stages on the West Coast, but Boeing was to
    manufacture the S-IC stage at Michoud-in Marshall's backyard, so to
    speak. So Boeing got an unusually close overview, and MSFC also got
    experience in how to handle its other contractors with Air Force
    experience.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Stoner later admitted that the close alliance
    with MSFC at the start had been extremely fruitful, working out
    problems before they arose, avoiding approaches that might have
    resulted in dead ends, and capitalizing on MSFC's engineering style
    and experience-especially welding technology-to avoid production
    difficulties and cost overruns. From his vantage point at NASA
    Headquarters, Milton Rosen accurately gauged the impact of MSFC on
    Boeing. All the expertise behind the V-2, Redstone, Jupiter, and
    Saturn I went into the S-IC stage, he noted. Any mistakes would have
    had to be Marshall's-and there were not many. "With Boeing, all the
    power of Marshall's engineering and experience went into that (S-IC)
    rocket," Rosen said.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Consistent with the MSFC insistence on
    in-house experience and capability, Marshall built three ground-test
    stages of the S-IC and the first two flight models. With the planned
    S-IC production facilities at Michoud still being modified, the MSFC
    production not only gave Boeing and Marshall people valuable early
    production experience, but also offered earlier delivery dates for
    test and flight stages. Using the tooling built at Boeing's Wichita
    facility and later installed at Marshall, Huntsville produced the
    S-IC-T, the S-IC-S, and the S-IC-F, and the first two flight models,
    the S-IC-1 and -2. The "T-Bird," as it was called, was built for
    static test firing; the "S," as a structural test model for load
    tests (it had no engines); and the "F," as a facilities test stage
    (also with no engines) to send to Cape Kennedy to aid in the checkout
    of the launch complex assembly buildings and launch equipment.
    Manufacture of these stages started in staggered sequence during
    1963. In addition, MSFC planned to make the first complete fuel tank
    at Huntsville; this would be the first item turned out on S-IC
    tooling. Based on early tests of the fuel tank, engineers intended to
    verify the design loads anticipated for both it and the oxidizer
    tank. Then production could proceed on all components.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="196"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">196</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] As MSFC finished
    using the initial batch of tooling equipment, it was sent on to
    Michoud for Boeing's subsequent use there, so that portions of
    several stages were under construction at the same time.
    Approximately 7 to 9 months were required to fabricate and assemble
    the tanks, the longest lead-time items, and about 14 months for the
    complete assembly of an S-IC. For its first unit, Boeing built a
    ground test dynamics model, the S-IC-D, giving the company production
    team at Michoud some experience before starting on its first flyable
    booster. The S-IC-D was planned to carry one genuine engine and four
    simulated engines. After shipment to Huntsville, the plan was to join
    this first stage with the S-II and S-IVB for dynamic tests of the
    total vehicle "stack" in a test facility at MSFC. One other test unit
    was produced at Michoud-a full-sized dummy model of the S-IC stage,
    billed as the largest mockup in the world. Built of metal, wood,
    fiberglass, etc., the mockup was primarily used to help fix the sizes
    and shapes of parts, test the angles of tubes and lengths, and see
    where wire bundles would run.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Because Chrysler produced the last Saturn I
    and Saturn IB first stages at Michoud, Boeing had to share the
    facility, but took 60 percent of the available space for the larger
    S-IC stage. The girth of the first stage also dictated removal of
    some of the overhead trusses and air conditioning ducts to allow a
    12.2-meter clearance for fabrication of the stages. This left a slim
    0.6-meter margin for the S-IC's 11.6-meter-diameter assembly
    fixture.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition, the heavy tooling required for
    the S-IC necessitated reinforcement of some parts of the floor.
    Boeing made another notable addition to the Michoud facility with the
    addition of a high-bay area for assembly of S-IC components. In the
    early stages of talks on S-IC production, the question of horizontal
    as opposed to vertical assembly of the tanks and components came up.
    The vertical assembly mode was selected, even though a new high-bay
    area was required, because horizontal assembly posed problems in
    maintaining accuracy of joints in the heavy, but thin-walled tanks.
    In vertical assembly, gravity held the huge parts together, although
    a 198-metric-ton crane was required to hoist the parts atop each
    other, and to lower the completed booster back to the horizontal for
    final finishing.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    engines and engine accessories, and miscellaneous equipment. There
    were also four "anchors" helping to hold the vehicle in place prior
    to liftoff. These aluminum forgings, some of the largest ever
    produced in the United States, were made in one of two presses in the
    country capable of 50 000 metric tons of pressure to form the basic
    forged billets, 4.3 meters long and 816 kilograms in weight. A
    tape-controlled milling machine carved out the multiple cavities,
    flanges, and attachment holes, leaving a finished product weighing
    almost one-third less. One of the distinctive features of the Saturn
    launch vehicle was the presence of four engine fairings and fins at
    the base of the S-IC and mounted on the exterior of the thrust
    structure. The fins added considerable stability to the vehicle, and
    were fabricated from titanium to withstand the 1100&#176;C heat from
    the engine exhaust. The four conical engine fairings smoothed the air
    flow at the base of the rocket and protected the engines from
    aerodynamic loads. In addition, each fairing carried a pair of
    retrorockets to decelerate the big booster after separation from the
    S-II stage; the retrorockets exerted a thrust of about 400 000
    newtons (90 000 pounds) during a burn time of less than a

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The propellant tanks included special fill and
    drain points to handle heavy-duty lines used to fill the big vessels
    at high rates; up to 7300 liters (2000 gallons) of RP-1 per minute.
    If left to its own devices inside the tank, the RP-1 would have
    settled into strata of varying temperatures, a highly undesirable
    situation, so the S-IC incorporated a fuel conditioning system to
    "stir" over 730 000 liters (200 000 gallons) of RP-1 gently by
    continuously bubbling gaseous nitrogen through the feed lines and the
    fuel tank prior to launch. To ensure proper engine start and
    operation, a fuel pressurization system contributed to good pressure
    at the fuel turbopump inlets where 10 fuel lines (two per engine)
    funneled RP-1 to the engines at 4900 liters (1350 gallons) per
    second. During the countdown, pressurization was supplied by a ground
    source, but during flight, a helium pressurant was supplied from
    elongated bottles stored, not on the fuel tank, but submerged in the
    liquid oxygen (LOX) tank. In this medium, the liquid helium in the
    bottles was in a much more compatible environment, because the cold
    temperature of the liquid helium containers could have frozen the
    RP-1 fuel. There were additional advantages to their location in the
    colder LOX tank. Immersed in liquid oxygen, the cryogenic effect on
    the aluminum bottles allowed them to be charged to higher pressures.
    They were also lighter, because the cryogenic environment permitted
    manufacture of the helium bottles with one-half the wall thickness of
    a noncryogenic bottle. Produced by the Martin Company, the four
    helium bottles, 6 meters long and 56 centimeters in diameter, were
    aluminum extensions of unique length. Ducts carried the cooling
    helium down through heat exchangers on the F-1 engines, then carried
    heated, expanded gaseous helium back to the top of the fuel tank for
    ullage pressure.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="199"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">199</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] With a capacity of
    1 204 000 liters (331 000 gallons), the LOX tank acquired its payload
    in stages, with a slow fill of 5500 liters (1500 gallons) per minute
    and a faster fill at a torrential rate of 36 000 liters (10 000
    gallons) per minute. The special problem of the LOX tank involved the
    feed lines leading to the thirsty engines about 15 meters below the
    fuel tanks. To do the job, the S-IC used five LOX suction lines,
    which carried oxidizer to the engines at 7300 liters (2000 gallons)
    per second. To achieve such high rates of flow, the lines could not
    be bent around the outside of the fuel tank; therefore, designers ran
    them right through the heart of the fuel tank. This in turn caused
    considerable fabrication problems, because it meant five extra holes
    in both the top and bottom of the fuel tank and presented the
    difficulty of avoiding frozen fuel around the super-cold LOX lines.
    The engineering fix on this included a system of tunnels, each one
    enclosing a LOX line, especially designed to carry an effective
    blanket of insulating air. Even so, the warmer fuel surrounding lines
    created some thermal difficulties in keeping the LOX lines properly
    cool. So the S-IC used some of its ground-supplied helium to bubble
    up through the LOX lines, and kept the liquid mixed at a sufficiently
    low temperature to avoid destructive boiling and geysering, or the
    creation of equally destructive cavities in the LOX pumps. To
    pressurize the tank, the S-IC tapped a helium ground source prior to
    launch. In flight, the LOX tank pressurization system used a system
    that tapped off some of the liquid oxygen, ran it through a heat
    exchanger to make it gaseous (called, naturally, GOX), and routed it
    back into the LOX tank.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Because the immense fuel and oxidizer vessels
    were separate items, the S-IC required additional pieces of hardware
    to make an integrated booster stage: the intertank and forward skirt.
    The intertank structure was a full seven meters in height itself,
    because the large bulges of the forward fuel tank dome and aft LOX
    dome extended inside it. There was a considerable amount of space
    remaining inside the intertank structure, which was given over to
    instrumentation cables, electrical conduit, telemetry lines, and
    other miscellany. Unlike the smooth skins of the propellant tanks,
    the unpressurized intertank structure required other means to
    maintain rigidity and carry the various stresses placed on it during
    launch. This requirement explains the distinctive appearance of both
    the intertank and the forward skirt, fabricated of 7075 aluminum
    alloy with corrugated skin and internal stringers (versus 2219
    aluminum for the tanks). Both structures also included various access
    doors and umbilical openings for servicing, inspection, and
    maintenance prior to launch. The forward skirt, three meters in
    height, enclosed the bulge of the LOX tank's forward bulkhead, and
    its upper edge constituted the separation plane between the S-IC and
    the S-II stages.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While Rocketdyne supplied the five F-1
    engines, the hydraulic system, used to actuate the gimbals, was
    included as part of the S-IC design. The hydraulic system featured a
    somewhat unconventional but [<A NAME="200"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">200</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] convenient
    approach, using RP-1 fuel as the actuating fluid. Although not
    unique, this use was not common practice in rocket engines. RP-1 fuel
    admittedly displayed certain drawbacks as a hydraulic fluid: it was
    less viscous, more corrosive, a poor lubricant, presented
    contamination problems, and posed a safety hazard with its relatively
    low flash point. Still, the use of RP-1 was appealing because it
    eliminated a separate hydraulic system. The RP-1 was taken directly
    from the high-pressure fuel duct, routed to the gimbal system, then
    back to the engine fuel system. To compensate for the shortcomings of
    RP-1 as the fluid, special care was taken in the design of valves,
    and a less volatile fluid (from an external source) was used when
    testing indoors and during prelaunch activities.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The S-IC carried a heavy load of
    instrumentation, particularly in the first few flights, to record and
    report information on its components, temperatures, pressures, and so
    on, totaling about 900 separate measurements. Much of the success of
    this complex web of instrumentation rested on the stage's
    transmitters and Boeing's achievement of some significant advances in
    the state of the art. A company team redesigned and rebuilt a 20-watt
    transmitter with solid-state components, rather than vacuum tubes.
    Relying on integrated circuits, such units were reduced to half the
    size of a pea, doing the same job with higher reliability than older
    units the size of a baseball.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The first two flight stages of the S-IC also
    carried visual instrumentation that yielded some unique and striking
    images. A pair of TV cameras covered the fiery environment of engine
    start and operation. The cameras were tucked away above the heat
    shield-safe from the heat, acoustic shock, and vibration of the open
    engine area-and the lenses were connected to serpentine lengths of
    fiber optic bundles, focused on the engine area, and were protected
    by special quartz windows. Fiber optic bundles also provided a field
    of vision into the LOX tank, with a pair of motion picture cameras
    using colored film to record behavior of the liquid oxygen in flight.
    The system offered a means to check on wave and sloshing motions in
    the huge tank, as well as the waterfall effects of LOX cascading off
    internal tank structures during the boost phase. Another pair of
    color motion picture cameras captured the spectacular moment of
    separation from the S-II stage. Twenty-five seconds after separation,
    the color cameras were ejected in a watertight capsule, attached to a
    parachute for recovery downrange in the South
    Atlantic.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    mammoth dimensions created [<A NAME="201"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">201</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] difficulties, not
    only in design, but in manufacturing and testing. In a speech to an
    annual meeting of the American Institute of Aeronautics and
    Astronautics in 1965, Whitney G. Smith, of Boeing's Launch Systems
    Branch, emphasized that "the tremendous size of this vehicle, coupled
    with its design complexities, have created many unique and
    challenging problems for the aerospace materials engineer." The basic
    complex challenge of the S-IC involved the scale of the stage itself
    in that it not only stretched the largest available tools to their
    maximum capacity, but also required the development of new techniques
    and facilities. Even old hands in the aerospace industry became
    fascinated by the size and scope of the S-IC stage fabrication and
    assembly, and magazines like </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Aviation
    Week and Space Technology</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> featured
    blow-by-blow accounts of fabrication and welding procedures with
    technical asides on each step of the process.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The arm-in-arm approach of Boeing and MSFC in
    the early S-IC design studies continued into the development of
    jumbo-sized tooling and fabrication concepts for the stage. Under the
    watchful eye of Jack Trott, MSFC's deputy director of the
    Manufacturing Engineering Division at that time, tooling such as
    assembly jigs and weld fixtures were tested; once they were deemed
    workable, Boeing received approval to build duplicates for
    installation later at Michoud. This phase of tooling-up required a
    certain amount of flexibility in the tool manufacturing scheme,
    because each Apollo mission featured variations and required a
    slightly different S-IC for each launch. For this reason, the tooling
    had to have a high degree of changeability. Boeing also worked with
    smaller inventories (because of probable design changes), and planned
    built-in time allowance in the manufacturing scheme to accommodate
    changes to a vehicle already moving along the production
    line.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.11">11</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Some techniques did not work out, as in the
    case of chemical sculpturing of the outsized gore segments used for
    the curved bulkheads of the fuel and oxidizer tanks. Each bulkhead
    was made up to eight of the large gores, shaped like a wedge of pie,
    which had been made from a base segment and apex segment. The curved
    gores were manufactured with a precise tapering thickness toward the
    tip, and included a waffled pattern in the base segment. Because of
    the contoured shape and various raised surfaces, a chemical milling
    process seemed most attractive for sculpturing the curved pieces. But
    by 1965, trial-and-error development led Boeing to rely on machine
    milling of the gore segments in the flat, and then hydraulically
    bulge-formed to the correct contours.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.12">12</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> The enormous bulge-formed dies to do this kind of job
    were located at Boeing-Wichita, where 90 percent of the parts for the
    S-IC were fabricated, then shipped to MSFC and Michoud to be
    manufactured into a complete booster stage.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to bulge-forming gore segments
    from heavy aluminum sheets (up to 27.6 square meters in size),
    Boeing-Wichita devised a technique that simultaneously age-hardened
    and formed the large aluminum alloy plates in an electric furnace.
    The plates that made up the tank [<A NAME="202"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">202</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] walls weighed five
    metric tons each, before they were milled down to weigh only one ton
    with walls about 60 millimeters thick. The tape- controlled form
    milling exposed the integral stiffeners, configured so that they were
    parallel to each other when the tank was in the curved condition.
    Mathias Siebel, director of MSFC's Manufacturing Engineering
    Laboratory, remarked that many test panels had to be machined to get
    the spacing and machine control tapes set up just right. Normally,
    the fabrication technique involved taking the 3.4 x 8-meter plates
    and rolling them to shape, heat treating in a restraining fixture,
    then further processing to eliminate distortions. Using its electric
    furnace, the Wichita plant turned out integrally stiffened fuel and
    LOX tank walls by clamping the piece to a precisely curved fixture
    that was a built-in part of the furnace. In this way, tank walls were
    age-hardened by heat and formed in the same
    process.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.13">13</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Eventually, the dozens of pieces of metal to
    make the S-IC tanks arrived at MSFC or Michoud to be welded together.
    The outsized dimensions of the pieces dictated modifications to
    standard welding procedures in which the welding tool was stationary
    and the piece to be welded was turned. Instead, the welding tools in
    most cases traveled along tracks over the components, held rigidly in
    huge jigs. The big problem was distortion, always a plague in the
    fabrication of light vessels (such as the Saturn tanks), and the S-IC
    propellant tanks were among the largest such lightweight vessels ever
    built. The primary cause of distortion was heat, and heat was
    unavoidable on the extended welding passes needed to make the vessel.
    Several actions were undertaken to reduce the heat and distortion
    factors. To ensure maximum weld conditions, the work was conducted in
    special areas with temperatures below 25&#176;C and the humidity
    below 50 percent. Otherwise, too many weld defects occurred in the
    work. In addition, special techniques were employed at the welding
    surface, particularly the use of the tungsten-inert-gas (TIG)
    process. The TIG method had been used in other applications but never
    to such a great extent as in the fabrication of aluminum tanks for
    Saturn. The inert gas shield protected the weld from air, offered
    more control of the process, and allowed anywhere from 2 to 30 passes
    over a single weld joint. An S-IC had about 10 kilometers of welding
    with every centimeter inspected. Under these constraints, welding
    teams numbered between 10 and 15 specialists, with procedures lasting
    up to eight hours and sequenced like the countdown of a launch
    vehicle.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.14">14</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Major welding operations entailed the joining
    of base and apex segments of the bulkhead gore segments into complete
    domes for the fuel and LOX tanks. The domes presented some difficult
    welding challenges when it came to welding various fittings and the
    several duct lines, because high residual stress in the huge curved
    components occasionally created a distortion effect known as
    "oil-canning." The distortions produced uneven surfaces that in turn
    upset the close [<A NAME="203"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">203</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] tolerances required
    for other welding operations. The LOX duct lines, for example, were
    welded to fittings in the curved bulkhead. Specifications allowed no
    more than 0.5 millimeter mismatch between the duct and the bulkhead
    fitting, involving a bias-cut joint 63 centimeters in diameter.
    Rather than return to a time-consuming process of age-forming in a
    special fixture, MSFC developed a special "electromagnetic hammer" to
    iron out the distortions. High voltage passing through a large coil
    created opposing fields between the distorted part and the "hammer."
    The opposing fields repelled, and because the mass of the coil was
    greater than the mass of the part, the part actually moved to
    eliminate the distortion. There was no physical impact between the
    part and the coil. In fact, demonstrators liked to lay a sheet of
    tissue paper between the coil and part, proceed with the "hammering,"
    and remove the tissue undamaged.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After several materials were rejected, the
    aluminum used in the fuel and LOX tanks was a 2219 alloy, chosen
    because of its variations in size, required for the S-IC, its
    weldability, and its resistance to stress corrosion. The propellant
    tank walls were welded into king-size hoops (10-meter-diameter), two
    for the fuel tank cylinder and four for the LOX tank cylinder. The
    tank cylinders included numerous circular slosh baffles designed for
    structural circularity and for slosh control. Additional slosh
    control was created by the installation of cruciform slosh control
    baffles in the aft domes of the fuel and LOX
    tanks.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.15">15</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Before the components of the propellant tanks
    were welded, they were subjected to special cleaning processes, with
    most attention given to the LOX tank. For all its desirability as an
    oxidant, LOX is highly volatile under certain conditions presenting
    unusual problems in the handling and fabrication of parts in contact
    with the oxidizer. Mixed with a hydrocarbon like grease or oil, LOX
    becomes extremely unstable, and even a very small spark can ignite
    the capricious stuff. Theoretically, if a worker left a fingerprint
    on the inside of a LOX tank, the oil in the fingerprint could cause
    an explosive situation. So, all surfaces coming in contact with LOX
    were kept virtually spotless with a rating of "LOX clean". At
    Michoud, Boeing prepared a series of big vats for cleaning components
    such as valves, tubes, and tank wall segments.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Depending on the specifications, several
    different cleansing processes could be used and technicians wore
    special lint-free gloves. A typical operation began by spraying the
    part with a degreasing compound, followed by washing in a detergent
    solution. Rinsing required water that had been carefully de-ionized
    and decontaminated. The part was then deoxydized with a solution of
    nitric acid and rinsed once more-but only in preparation for
    additional cleaning. After being heated, the part underwent the next
    step; an etching process that actually removed a micro-thin layer of
    surface material. Following a final rinse, drying was done with a
    blast of hot air, which was especially filtered to be oil-free. In
    addition to the cleaning of the segments, subassemblies like
    bulkheads..... </FONT></P>

    cylinders and domes together, the size of the S-IC required the
    production of a special rig known as the Y-ring. The longest
    "lead-time" item in the S-IC manufacturing process, the Y-ring
    required two months to complete at Michoud. It consisted of three
    aluminum billets welded into a ring and then carefully machined to
    the correct shape in several closely controlled
    phases.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    the tank domes, walls, and adjoining structure (like the interbank
    segment) came together. Each Y-ring featured one straight side as the
    meeting point for the vertical sides of the tank well and adjoining
    structure, and one appropriately angled area to serve as the meeting
    point for the upper or lower tank dome.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the vertical assembly area at Michoud,
    complete fuel and LOX tanks were formed and then hydrostatically
    tested to 105 percent of the total pressure anticipated in a mission.
    This overpressurization created a certain amount of danger in the
    test area, so the test was monitored by a bank of closed circuit TV
    cameras. Demineralized water was used in the test sequence, with
    special dyes added to show up on the cameras if minute seepages
    occurred. The hydrostatic tests exerted so much force on the tanks
    that their dimensions were actually stretched by 1.3 centimeters at
    the bottom. After flushing and cleaning procedures, the tanks were
    accurately calibrated for the exact propellant capacity by refilling
    with water of an established weight, temperature, and specific
    gravity. The entire S-IC was then stacked from the bottom up,
    beginning with the thrust structure, and attached together at the
    Y-ring juncture with special fittings. The completed S-IC was loaded
    on a special dolly and moved to the low-bay area for the installation
    of engines and miscellaneous equipment. It was moved very carefully,
    however, because the horizontal stage on its transporter had only a
    14-centimeter roof clearance.</FONT></P>

    thousands of tests, large and small, conducted on the S-IC before

    tests, and other examinations were made to ensure the stage's
    fitness. Before static test firing, for example, S-IC stages spent 10
    full weeks in a test cell at Michoud for scrutiny of the completed

    in the summer of 1965, the MTF stand for the S-IC began operations
    about a year later and became the focus of the static test firing
    program. It seemed quite appropriate that the howling, thunderous
    roar of the S-IC cluster could so often be heard at an area
    originally known as Devil's Swamp.</FONT></P>

    1600 steel pilings, each 30 meters long, and the S-IC was secured by
    four huge hold-down arms anchored to a slab of concrete 12 meters
    thick. The massive jaws of the restraining arms clamped onto the
    rocket tail by means of drive mechanisms geared to move only 8
    centimeters per minute. From a distance, the big test tower looked
    like a concrete monolith; its hollow legs were the equivalent of a
    20-story building with offices, machine shops, data centers, and
    elevators. With the huge volume of LOX and kerosene in the rocket
    tanks, a catastrophic fire during testing was always a consideration;
    as a result all personnel were evacuated to remote bunkers before
    ignition. In case of a fire during a test, a water deluge system,
    evidenced by the myriad of pipes lacing up and down the structure,
    could spray 782 000 liters (215 000 gallons) per minute over the
    stand. Moreover, engine tests required a second water deluge system
    that supplied the stand with 1 100 000 liters (300 000 gallons) of
    water per minute through a double-walled steel flame bucket directly
    below the F-1 cluster. Thousands of holes in the outer walls of the
    flame bucket allowed water to gush out to cool the bucket and keep it
    intact for the next test. During a five-minute test run, the S-IC
    test stand got enough water to supply a city of 10 000 for a
    day.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Any problems in the S-IC program seem to have
    occurred mostly at the start but were resolved before a serious
    impasse developed. Matt Urlaub recalled early confrontations between
    various Boeing and Marshall people over management issues.
    "Boeing...had a very strong sense of accomplishment up to that point,
    and they knew they had built large airplanes before, and this [S-IC]
    vehicle isn't much different... and we were, in those days, a pretty
    proud organization too." Both sides eventually adjusted, however,
    "getting the pecking order straight," as Urlaub put it. In 1963 the
    S-IC program encountered a succession of welding problems that
    persisted throughout the next year. Portions of the S-IC-T vehicle
    were scrapped because of welding deficiencies in the propellant
    tanks, and the S-IC-T generally lagged six weeks behind schedule
    during 1964. An upper LOX tank bulkhead for S-IC-S was scrapped "due
    to poor quality" in October, and at the same time, the manufacturing
    schedule for S-IC-T was reported to be 19 weeks behind.... </FONT>

    within the report of the Silverstein committee in December 1959, when
    its members recommended the development of the high-thrust, liquid-
    hydrogen-fueled engine. In less than a year, Rocketdyne won the
    contract for the J-2 engine. Because many of the engine design
    parameters depended on stage configuration and mission profiles,
    designers had also begun parallel design studies on the stage itself.
    These studies sprang from the Silverstein committee's original
    report, which included a LOX-LH</FONT><SUB><FONT

    T. Keith Glennan wanted to make sure that an S-II stage received his

    Glennan hedged a bit in January 1961, when Major General Don R.
    Ostrander, Director of the Office of Launch Vehicle Programs, pushed
    for definition of the C-2 vehicle configuration, including initiation
    of contract work for the S-II. Glennan hesitated because he did not
    want to "bind the new Administrator to an expenditure which will run
    several hundred millions of dollars," and because he felt it wiser to
    see how the J-2 engine program progressed. There was no doubt in his
    mind, however, concerning the desirability of the S-II stage as part
    of the C-2. The C-1 vehicle did not have the capabilities NASA needed
    for the long term. "The Saturn program is left in mid-stream,"
    Glennan emphasized in the transition memo he left for his successor,

    new Administrator in 1961, NASA authorized the Marshall center to
    proceed with contractor selection. MSFC's invitations to a
    preproposal conference in Huntsville in April attracted 30 aerospace
    firms. As described by MSFC at that time, the S-II second stage of
    the Saturn C-2 vehicle was presented as the largest rocket project,
    in terms of physical size, to be undertaken by American industry.
    Powered by four of the new J-2 engines, the preliminary configuration
    of the second stage was given dimensions of 22.5 meters in length and
    6.5 meters in diameter. The implied challenge must have been
    sobering, since 23 of the companies did not submit proposals the
    following month for the first phase of the S-II contractor selection
    process. The seven firms left in the running included Aerojet General
    Corporation; Chrysler Corporation, Missile Division; Convair
    Astronautics Division of General Dynamics Corporation; Douglas
    Aircraft Corporation; Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, Georgia
    Division; Martin Company; and North American Aviation, Incorporated.
    They submitted briefs to MSFC concerning their experience and

    source evaluation board using a numerical scoring system geared to
    the phase one proposals. Three firms were eliminated, leaving
    Aerojet, Convair, Douglas, and North American. These four companies
    were about to receive a surprise, because NASA had decided to change
    the configuration of the second stage. On 8 June, Webb circulated a
    memo to his top advisors specifying that the Saturn C-2 simply could
    not boost the Apollo spacecraft to the escape velocity required for a
    circumlunar mission. NASA was now considering the C-3, which
    consisted of a fatter first stage powered by two F-1 engines and a
    larger S-II stage. As Webb noted, the C-3 had not yet been

    FACE="Geneva"> and the four contractors, gathering late in June for
    the phase two conference, discovered they would have to grapple with
    some very loose ends.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The phase two conference opened with remarks
    by Oswald Lange, Chief of the Saturn Systems Office. In his initial
    statement, Lange explained why the C-2 configuration was going to be
    bypassed in favor of the C-3. Recent research on the problem of
    radiation in space indicated that the spacecraft needed more
    shielding, which would increase spacecraft weight from the original
    6800-kilogram estimate to 13 600 kilograms. Moreover, Lange revealed,
    the original S-II diameter of 6.6 meters was now enlarged to 8.13
    meters to be more compatible with the C-3's first stage and allow
    better payload flexibility in the future. On the other hand, Lange
    said, he was not able as yet to give the contractors hard figures on
    the exact configuration of the stages above the 8.13-meter S-II
    (making it difficult to figure out the mechanics of boost, separation
    of upper stages, and other aspects, as one contractor noted); indeed,
    MSFC might decide on an even larger 9.14-meter stage! "It may be a
    little hard [<A NAME="211"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">211</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] for you to
    speculate a design if we give you such soft indications of the
    configuration that we ultimately want," Lange admitted, but pledged
    to have firm numbers when Marshall and the winning contractor sat
    down to hammer out the details in final contract negotiations.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In a question-and-answer session that
    followed, a Marshall spokesman, after elaborating on some of the
    aspects of the proposals, apologetically echoed Lange, and explained
    that Marshall was anxious to get started on the contracts. "You can
    see that we have a whole lot of doubt in what we say here, and there
    are a lot of conflicting problems," the spokesman admitted. "We are
    presently trying to resolve them. We could have asked you not to come
    here today and could have taken, say, six weeks time to resolve these
    problems internally, in which case we would have lost six weeks on
    the S-II contract." Speaking with candor, he told the contractors,
    "This of course puts the monkey on your back, and we know that!"
    However, even with all of this looseness in the preliminary stages of
    finalizing the contract, Marshall made it clear that firm figures for
    the stage would be forthcoming, and that contractors would be held
    strictly accountable. As Wilbur Davis, of the MSFC Procurement and
    Contracts Office, stated it, "I wish to emphasize at this point that
    the important product that NASA will buy in this procurement is the
    efficient management of a stage system."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    Navy, designated as the government's construction agency, did not
    always proceed well, and led to the dispatch of NASA investigation
    teams from Headquarters. In spite of the problems in the three-way
    arrangement, D. Brainerd Holmes emphasized in the spring of 1963 that
    "we are getting these facilities on time and the construction is
    excellent." By early autumn, North American was putting together the

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The S-II turned out to be a comparatively
    advanced stage in terms of the existing state of the art. Although
    the S-II carried about 426 400 kilograms of liquid oxygen and liquid
    hydrogen, the tank structure, though supporting the structural mass,
    accounted for just a shade over three percent of the stage's total
    fueled weight. A common bulkhead much larger than that in any
    previous rocket averted the need for an
    [<A NAME="212"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">212</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] interstage between the oxidizer and fuel tanks; this
    reduced the total length of the stage by over 3 meters and saved
    about 4 metric tons of extra weight. In technical terms, the
    fabrication of the bulkheads called for unusually demanding accuracy
    in meridian welds that joined the bulkhead gores together. The
    welding operation joining the curved, 6-meter-long seams together had
    to be made to specifications allowing less than 0.33 millimeter of a
    mismatch. Then there was the problem of insulating the big liquid
    hydrogen tank, filled with thousands of liters of the super-cold
    propellant. Otherwise, the basic design elements of the S-II seemed
    conventional enough in that it consisted of eight major structural
    components and six major systems, all of which reflected the usual
    kind of basic elements associated with both the S-IC and the
    S-IVB.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.28">28</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The vehicle was assembled at Seal Beach, where
    most of the major structural elements were fabricated. Exceptions
    were the interstage, aft skirt, thrust structure, and forward skirt
    which were produced at North American's plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The
    interstage, aft skirt, and forward skirt, all of semimonocoque
    construction, had been designed for structural rigidity. The thrust
    structure (in the usual inverted cone shape) featured both
    high-strength riveting and thrust longerons to handle the full thrust
    of the J-2 engine cluster. Fabricated in separate pieces, the aft
    skirt and thrust structure were intended to serve as a single
    structural entity when joined together. The combination served as a
    mounting point for the five engines, the heat shield, and assorted
    plumbing and black boxes.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In a sequence known as dual-plane separation,
    the interstage, although joined to the aft skirt, uncoupled from the
    S-II after staging from the S-IC. Following burnout of the first
    stage, a linear-shaped charge separated the S-II from the S-IC; this
    procedure was simultaneous with the firing of S-IC retrorockets and
    eight ullage motors on the interstage of the S-II. About 30 seconds
    after first-stage separation, the S-II interstage separated from the
    second stage itself. Initiation of the dual-plane separation maneuver
    occurred when the outboard J-2 engines reached 90 percent of their
    maximum thrust; at this point, explosive charges were triggered,
    which severed the interstage. The maneuver required a precise
    separation that would propel the interstage (5.4 meters long)
    rearward, clearing the engines by approximately 1 meter, while the
    S-II was accelerating to its blinding top speed. Once free of the
    interstage mass, the performance of the S-II was greatly enhanced.
    The dual-plane separation was an alternative to a method called "fire
    in the hole," which involved ignition and separation of the S-II
    while still contact with the interstage but not attached to it.
    Designers preferred to avoid this alternative because of possible
    perturbations and oscillations the end of the first-stage boost
    phase. With the S-II accelerating on an even course, it was easier to
    drop the interstage during that phase, rather
    [<A NAME="213"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">213</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] than risk hitting a wobbling interstage attached to
    the S-IC as the S-II pulled out.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The LOX tank of the S-II stage, like that of
    the S-IVB, incorporated the principle of the common bulkhead, which
    comprised the top half of the LOX tank. With its 10-meter diameter
    and 6.7-meter height, the ellipsoidal container had a squat
    appearance. Having no vertical walls to speak of, the LOX tank was
    constructed by welding together a dozen gores and finishing off the
    tank with "dollar sections," large circular pieces joining the ends
    of the gores at the top and bottom. The top of the LOX tank actually
    formed one half of the common bulkhead. After welding this part of
    the LOX tank, the common bulkhead was completed before adding the
    tank's bottom half to it. Early on, the forming of the gore segments
    for all the bulkhead assemblies frustrated manufacturing engineers,
    because no techniques existed for forming such large, unwieldy
    pieces. Each gore was approximately 2.6 meters wide at the base and
    had complex curvatures that were difficult to form accurately. After
    rejecting numerous possible procedures, the manufacturing team
    finally chose a somewhat exotic method-underwater explosive forming.
    This technique quite literally blasted the wedge-shaped gores into
    shape. North American's Los Angeles Division produced the gores,
    using a 211 000-liter (58 000-gallon) tank of water at nearby El Toro
    Marine Base for explosive, or "high-energy," forming. After
    positioning the gore segment in the tank, engineers detonated a
    carefully located network of primacord explosive, forming the metal
    by the blast transmitted through the water. The formation of each
    gore required three separate blasts.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.29">29</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the start of the S-II program, MSFC
    questioned North American's proposals for a common bulkhead. Despite
    the S-IV stage common bulkhead, engineers at Huntsville remained
    skeptical of North American's ability to produce a common bulkhead of

    and pressures of much greater volumes of cryogenic propellants.
    Marshall insisted on parallel backup schemes using more conventional
    bulkhead designs, in case North American's idea failed. On the other
    hand, North American insisted on its common bulkhead to reduce stage
    length and weight from the conventional form of two separate fuel and
    oxidizer tanks connected by an interstage component. The company had
    to work out several new fabrication techniques to do the
    job.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Beginning with the upper half of the LOX tank,
    fabrication of the common bulkhead required a number of carefully
    timed and sequenced operations. First, honeycomb phenolic insulation
    was fitted over the upper surface of the LOX tank dome, called the
    aft facing sheet because it served as the bottom of the common
    bulkhead. Then the insulation was bonded to the aft facing sheet and
    cured in a gargantuan autoclave. Next came the preliminary fitting of
    the forward facing sheet; this piece became the bottom half of the
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    tank (also formed from large [<A NAME="214"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">214</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] wedge-shaped
    gores). Preliminary fitting of the forward facing sheet revealed
    surfaces in the insulation that needed to be filled in or shaved down
    for a perfect fit, using a machine controlled by data-tapes.
    Throughout the process, numerous checks were made to ensure that no
    gaps were left between the insulation and the facing sheets;
    ultrasonic equipment verified complete bonding of the
    adhesives.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fitting the honeycomb core to the bulkhead
    domes was one of the most critical operations in the S-II
    manufacturing sequence. The chemically milled gores tapered from
    about 13 millimeters thickness at the base to 0.79 millimeter at the
    apex. With these thin sections, the great domes possessed relatively
    little strength by themselves and tended to sag; this situation
    created severe production problems in achieving the close fit
    required between the top and bottom domes and the insulation core.
    The honeycomb sandwich, which comprised the core, measured nearly 13
    centimeters thick at the peak of the common bulkhead and tapered off
    at the bottom periphery, where more thickness was not necessary. So
    the honeycomb core, like the gores, had to be shaped to complex
    curvatures, tapered, and affixed without gaps to the flexible dome
    surfaces.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The procedure finally worked out by North
    American manufacturing teams was heralded by the company as "a major
    advance in missile fabrication." Workers applied a low pressure
    inflation force to the aft facing sheet, giving it full contour and
    providing accurate dimensional traces for fitting the honeycomb
    insulation core. The forward facing sheet presented a different
    problem; since the top surface of the insulation core had to be
    fitted to the underside of the forward facing sheet, the inflation
    technique was ruled out. Instead, NAA devised a huge vacuum bell.
    Fitted over the forward facing sheet, the vacuum bell sucked up the
    sheet to a fully contoured position. Afterward, handling slings
    lowered the entire assembly over the rigidly pressurized aft facing
    sheet to record the final set of dimensional traces for shaping the
    insulation surfaces.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    inside the fuel tank. This trade-off confronted the company with the
    problem of adequate external insulation and with special difficulties
    in bonding the insulation to the super-cold surfaces of the fuel
    tank. The original solution specified external insulation made of
    phenolic honeycomb filled with a heat-resistant foam of isocyanate.
    Fabricated in panels, the insulation material was sealed at the top
    and bottom with a phenolic laminate followed by a layer of Tedlar
    plastic film. The process of bonding the insulation panels to the
    tank created potential hazards. Air pockets next to the super-cold
    metal could be turned into puddles of liquid oxygen; these puddles
    could eventually weaken the bonding, thereby allowing large panels to
    peel off. To avoid this, the S-II stage featured a liquid-helium
    purge of the insulation through grooves cut into the insulation
    surface next to the tank walls. Helium flowed through the grooves
    from the start of hydrogen loading through countdown and up to the
    instant of launch.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Unfortunately, this design never worked very
    well. The purge system was tricky, the insulation bonding repeatedly
    failed, and chunks of insulation continued to fall off during tanking
    and test sequences. Although several S-II stages were produced with
    the original insulation concept, the results were so discouraging
    that North American spent considerable time and money working up an
    alternative. Instead of making up panels and affixing them to the
    tank, the company finally evolved a process for spraying insulation
    material directly onto the tank walls (eliminating the air pockets),
    letting it cure, then cutting it to the proper contour. This
    technique turned out to be much more economical and much lighter than
    the insulation panels.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Eventually, all the parts of the S-II came
    together in the vertical assembly building at Seal Beach. Vertical
    assembly was chosen for its advantages in joining major parts and
    ease of welding. In vertical assembly, as opposed to horizontal
    assembly, it was easier to maintain circumference of the large
    diameter parts to close tolerances and gravitational force helped
    maintain stage alignment. Moreover, if the various cylinders and
    bulkheads were horizontal, temperature diversion about the
    circumference of the parts would produce distortions at the top of
    the piece being welded. Throughout each welding sequence, technicians
    employed a variety of special scopes, levels, and traditional plumb
    bobs to make sure alignments were exact. Additionally, the stage was
    subjected to hydrostatic, x-ray, dye penetrant, and other checks to
    ensure proper specifications. One of the last items to be added was
    the systems tunnel, affixed to the exterior of the stage. The tunnel,
    a semicircular structure, ran vertically up the side of the S-II and
    carried miscellaneous instrumentation along with wires and tubes that
    connected system components at the top and bottom of the
    stage.</FONT></P>

    the tanks included installation of slosh baffles, probes, and other
    miscellaneous equipment. In preparation for these operations, all
    surfaces inside the tanks were thoroughly cleansed, flushed with
    trichloroethylene, and dried. Flushing equipment consisted of a spray
    nozzle fitted to a movable lifting cylinder, similar to the hydraulic
    lifts used in filling stations. After the flushing, a team of
    technicians mounted a ladder and platform attachment on the movable
    lifting cylinder, entered the tanks, and began final installation of
    equipment. With all accessories installed, the tanks had to be

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Of the six major systems, the propellant
    system was the most complex. The seven propellant subsystems included
    plumbing, hardware, and control to accomplish the following: purge,
    fill and replenish, venting, pressurization, propellant feed,
    recirculation, and propellant management. Elements were largely
    designed to cope with the tricky characteristics of the cryogenics
    carried on board the S-II stage. By using helium gas, the purge
    subsystem cleared the tank of contaminants like moisture (which could
    freeze and block valves or vents) in the LOX tank, and oxygen (which
    could freeze and create danger of explosions) in the
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    tank. The fill and replenish subsystem (along with the recirculation
    cycle), helped relieve the tanks, valves, pumps, and feed lines of
    the thermal shocks encountered from the sudden introduction of
    ultra-cold propellants into the stage.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The recirculation subsystem kept propellants
    moving through the engine pumps and associated plumbing while keeping
    them properly chilled and ready for operation. Similarly, the fill
    and replenish system brought the propellant tanks and their related
    plumbing down to a temperature suitable for loading of the cryogenic
    propellants. The procedure began by circulating cold gas through the
    tanks and lines, followed by a "chilldown" cycle-slow pumping of
    propellants into the tanks until they reached the five percent level.
    Even with the preliminary cooling by chilled gas, the tanks were so
    much warmer than the propellants that much of the liquid boiled off
    when it first gushed into the tank; the "chilldown" dropped the tank
    temperatures to a point where fast fill could then proceed. Because
    the propellants were pumped into the tanks hours before liftoff and a
    certain amount of boil-off [<A NAME="217"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">217</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] persisted, constant
    replenishment was required until a minute or two before liftoff.
    Venting subsystems prevented overpressurization of the tanks, while a
    pressurization subsystem maintained propellant flow. Other subsystems
    for feeding the propellant from tanks to engines as well as
    propellant management (simultaneous depletion of tanks, engine
    cutoff, etc.) completed the propellant system network.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Other major systems (electrical, ordnance,
    measurement, thermal control, and flight control) were similar in
    basic functions to those on other Saturn stages. The same was true

    engine compartment conditioning, and other

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The size of the S-Il included dimensions
    normally associated with the bulky fittings and burly strength of
    heavy industry. The inside of the S-II was roomy enough to stack
    three standard railroad tank cars end to end, with room to spare for
    a caboose lying sideways on top. Yet, the 24.8-meter stage weighed
    only 43 100 kilograms in its dry stage (by comparison, the three
    empty tank cars would weigh more than 95 700 kilograms). In spite of
    its massive appearance, the S-II was honed to the precise standards
    of the watchmaker. Almost one kilometer of welded joints had to be
    surgically clean and flawless, and many had to be accurate to 0.33 of
    a millimeter. The structural efficiency of the stage, in terms of the
    weight and pressures taken by its extra-thin walls, was comparable
    only to the capacity of one of nature's most refined examples of
    structural efficiency, the egg.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even with all this description of the
    meticulous workmanship lavished on the S-II, the layman still might
    enquire, "so what?" What was so challenging, to the platoons of
    engineers and technicians who did it, about welding together a big
    rocket stage? One problem was the nature of the tank skins
    themselves. The S-II was built of an aluminum alloy known as 2014 T6,
    which was not generally favored for welding. North American knew the
    welding job was going to be complicated but wanted to use the alloy
    because of its enhanced strength under cryogenic conditions. A theme
    of the entire Saturn program was "size," and the challenges inherent
    in the S-II were similarly challenges of magnitude. With a diameter
    of 10 meters, the stage required circumferential welds of 31.4
    meters. The longer the weld, the tougher the problem of sustaining
    quality and close tolerances-and in the S-II, weld quality and close
    tolerances were essential. A high quality weld pass of 1 meter might
    be one thing, but a virtually flawless circumferential weld of 31.4
    meters promised all manner of increasing heat input problems and
    attendant [<A NAME="218"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">218</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] distortion problems
    where none could be tolerated. "I had very little gray hair when we
    started," admitted Norm Wilson, manager of the Manufacturing
    Engineering Section for the S-II at Seal Beach. "But look at me now,"
    he said in 1968.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.35">35</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Wilson's gray hair owed much to the multitude
    of variations and requirements implicit in the plethora of tricky
    welding tasks all over the stage, aside from the circumferential
    jobs. The various aluminum sheets joined together in the welding
    process varied in shape, size, and thickness, all of which caused
    different problems for the welder. One such joint had skins that
    tapered from 16 millimeters thick down to under 6 millimeters, then
    back up to 13 millimeters. The shifting thicknesses frequently made
    temperamental men of normally even-tempered welding engineers; weld
    speeds, arc voltages, and other regimes had to be tailored for each
    variance during the welding pass. Minuscule cracks, tiny bits of
    foreign material in the weld seams, moisture, or other apparently
    innocuous imperfections could leak volatile propellants or cause
    catastrophic weaknesses under the pressures and loads experienced in
    flight.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"You can't really say our work has been
    exotic," Wilson said. "But when you consider the sizes, angles,
    lengths, designs, offset tolerances, and overall specifications
    involved, you have one challenging welding problem on your hands.
    We've had to tap our experience well dry and tax our imagination to
    come up with the right answers, and it has been only through the
    combined contributions of many that we have been
    successful."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.36">36</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> It was a genuine team effort, with increasing reliance
    on automated welding technology. The virtuoso performances of the
    individual welder, plying his torch with sparks flying around his
    visored head, became an anachronism. In the case of the big bulkhead
    domes, the gore sections were joined two at a time while held rigidly
    by vacuum chucks in a precision-contoured welding jig. The welding
    torch, part of an automatic power pack, moved along an apparatus
    called a skate track, which was mounted on the exterior surface of
    the gores. Inching upward at a carefully geared speed, the automatic
    power pack "remembered" each detail of the three-step welding
    operation: trimming, welding, and x-raying in sequence. Each program
    for the automatic power pack evolved from elaborate trials on test
    panels; checking and rechecking the accuracy of the trim procedure;
    precise current, arc voltage, and welding speed for the torch head;
    and quality of the x-ray. A technician rode along on the track to
    monitor the procedure or stop it if necessary, but the machine
    basically did its own thing in its own way.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The tank cylinder walls posed a far different
    set of problems. Each wall was machined, formed, and assembled by
    many different manufacturing methods; each varied because of the
    stresses of movement from one industrial site to another, and
    exposure to different influences of heat and climate. One of the most
    difficult aspects originated in the initial
    [<A NAME="219"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">219</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] fabrication process. Each of the four cylinder
    sections was machined as a flat piece, then contoured to shape and
    welded together, with different stress factors from one completed
    cylinder to another. Before each welding operation, technicians
    reminded themselves that the cylinders were seldom true circles with
    nice flat surfaces for welding. During one of the first attempts to
    weld two cylinders together, 80 percent of the job was complete when
    the remaining section suddenly ballooned out of shape-the result of
    heat buildup and increasing stress from distortion. Exasperated
    specialists brainstormed the aggravating phenomenon, and tried to
    come up with a suitable "fix" for the problem. As a result, all the
    weld parameters had to be revised to include different tooling and
    new procedures using a series of "tack welds" evenly spaced around
    the circumference followed by three more passes using two skate
    welders operating simultaneously 180 degrees apart.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One of the most trying welding jobs in the
    whole operation was the joining of the forward LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> bulkhead to the
    uppermost LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> tank cylinder where the mismatch could be no more than
    0.69 millimeter. Time after time, weld defects or mismatches
    occurred. Each reject required time-consuming efforts to cut open the
    weld, realign the pieces, and start over again. Delays at this step
    began to disrupt the whole program and raised the specter of late
    deliveries and slips in the launch schedule.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Late in 1966, a combined trouble-shooting
    committee was set up and jointly chaired by Werner Kuers, of the
    Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory at MSFC, and Ralph Ruud,
    executive vice-president of North American's Space &amp; Information
    Systems Division. This joint approach to solving severe production
    problems was reflected down through the ranks, with contractor and
    NASA technicians working shoulder to shoulder in searching for
    answers. Among other things, the existing humidity conditions in the
    manufacturing area were reduced from 50-60 percent to only 30 percent
    to enhance the probability of better weld quality. An environmentally
    controlled, clean-room atmosphere was established by hanging huge
    canvas curtains in one corner of the assembly building. Personnel had
    to pass through a double-door airlock to get in and out of the
    welding area; they were required to wear white, lint-free smocks and
    gloves as well as step through an electric shoe brush machine to
    remove dirt picked up from the floor outside. Inside the clean-room
    area, workers continually mopped the epoxy floors to keep them free
    of moisture and extraneous particles; no smoking or eating was
    permitted in the area, and adjacent walls were painted a stark white
    to remind everyone in the vicinity to "think clean."</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Kuers-Ruud team recommended a major change
    in the welding procedure itself. North American welding engineers had

    prior MSFC experiments and previous applications in production of the

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the weight of the Apollo payloads
    relentlessly climbed during the early 1960s, NASA engineers redoubled
    efforts to lighten the stages. To get one more kilogram of payload,
    the laws of orbital mechanics required that 14 kilograms be cut from
    the S-IC; or four to five kilograms from the S-II; but only one from
    the S-IVB. The S-IVB stage was already in production when the weight
    problem became acute-it was too late to slice anything from that
    stage, where the advantage was greatest. Trying to scrape 14
    kilograms out of the S-IC to save 1 kilogram of payload just was not
    feasible in terms of time and effort. That left the S-II. As the
    second stage became a more finely honed and thin-shelled vehicle, the
    balance between success or failure became more delicate. This was
    especially true when welding the large, thin tank skins of the S-II
    stage.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Manufacturing challenges such as reducing
    stage weight and the unusually long welding runs were not the only
    situations that escalated the S-II's troubles. Another persistent
    problem, for example, centered on the insulation for the
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    tank. MSFC technical monitors became increasingly concerned during
    the spring of 1964 and reported "considerable difficulty" in

    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> tank insulation; the
    growing problem crept up unawares, so to speak, and was reported with
    a note of surprise at MSFC. "The S-II stage insulation concept for
    vehicles 501, 502, 503 and to a somewhat lesser extent for S-II
    [ground-test vehicles] has not been fully qualified as of this date,"
    read a memorandum dated 2 [<A NAME="223"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">223</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] June 1964. The memo
    candidly added, "This fact was discovered by Marshall personnel and
    came as quite a shock to S&amp;ID management and needless to say,
    MSFC." The memo noted a number of anomalies, chief of which was the
    debonding of the nylon outer layer from the honeycomb material
    underneath when exposed to a simulated flight environment. The
    insulation difficulties became symptomatic. More serious production
    troubles appeared starting in October 1964, when burst tests revealed
    welded cylinder specimens lower in weld strength than anticipated.
    Then, on 28 October 1964, the first completed aft bulkhead for the
    S-II-S ruptured during a hydrostatic proof test, although at a lower
    pressure than specifications dictated. The fault was traced to a
    previous repair weld, done by hand, along a recirculation system
    service plate. While welding of a replacement bulkhead proceeded, a
    design change eliminated the welded service plate, making it an
    integral part of the bulkhead gore.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The continuing snags involving the S-II began
    to cause worry lines in the brows of managers at MSFC and
    Headquarters; in particular was the need to get the first S-II flight
    stage, S-II-1, out the door at Seal Beach, tested, and delivered to
    Cape Kennedy for the first Saturn V launch, AS-501, in 1967.
    Production troubles with the S-II ground-test stages by late 1964 and
    early 1965 threatened the S-II-1 so much that MSFC's director,
    Wernher von Braun, proposed a reworking of the whole S-II test
    program to make up some of the slippages. Major General Samuel C.
    Phillips, from his vantage point as Director of the Apollo Program in
    Washington, concurred and set in motion a series of shortcuts in the
    spring of 1965 to put the S-II schedule back in shape. Specifically,
    NASA decided to cancel the dynamic test stage (S-II-D) and, instead,
    use the S-II-S for this purpose after its structural tests. This
    decision greatly relieved both manufacturing and assembly pressures
    on flight stages at Seal Beach and permitted use of S-II-D hardware
    in follow-on stages. Further, the "all-systems" test stage bypassed
    its scheduled tests at Santa Susana and was scheduled for direct
    delivery to MTF. Meanwhile, the S-II-F facility checkout stage was
    scheduled to bypass MTF (where the all-systems stage would be used
    for facility activation purposes) for delivery direct to the Cape.
    There, the S-II-F would be pressed immediately into service to give
    Launch Complex 39 a thorough and complete checkout before the first
    flight stage arrived. In addition to relieving pressure on the
    schedule, these changes netted a savings of $17
    million.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Following these early deviations, the S-II
    program appeared to be proceeding well until MSFC decided in May to
    freeze the configuration of the S-II. Explaining the decision, Arthur
    Rudolph, Saturn V Program Manager, said that because production
    hardware was in the process of fabrication, engineering change
    activities on vehicles and ground support equipment should be frozen
    to the "present baseline configuration."

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Welding continued to be troublesome. Early in
    July, the Space and Information Systems Division (S&amp;ID) began
    preparations for making the first circumferential welds on the S-II-1
    (destined to be the first flight-rated stage). After completing the
    operation on 19 July, the weld was found to be faulty and repairs
    stretched into the first week of August before additional work on the

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then the first incident in a chain of
    misfortunes occurred that created one of the most serious times of
    trouble in the development of the Saturn V. On 29 September 1965, the
    S-II-S/D (structures-dynamic-test stage) ruptured and fell apart
    during a loading test at Seal Beach. Destruction of the stage
    transpired during a test to simulate the forces acting on the stage
    at the end of the S-IC boost phase. MSFC quickly organized an ad hoc
    group to determine the reasons for the accident, tagging it with a
    rather dramatic title, the S-II-S/D Catastrophic Failure Evaluation
    Team. Additionally, Marshall added a Debris Evaluation Team to help
    pinpoint the component that caused the failure. While the
    Catastrophic Failure Evaluation Team started sifting reports, Colonel
    Sam Yarchin, the S-II Stage Manager, instructed the people at Seal
    Beach to untangle the twisted metal debris in the test tower and lay
    it out in orderly fashion inside a guarded enclosure for minute
    examination by the debris evaluation team. It was eventually
    determined that the point of failure had been in the aft skirt area
    at 144 percent of the limit load. Even though considerable data had
    been accumulated on this particular test and earlier tests, the loss
    of the stage left a void in the planned vehicle dynamic tests at
    Huntsville; the test program was juggled around to use the S-II-T
    stage instead, following static testing at MTF.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The loss of S-II-S and continuing difficulties
    with the S-II at Seal Beach caused increasing consternation at MSFC.
    When the president of North American, J.L. Atwood, visited von Braun
    in Huntsville on 14 October, he found an indignant mood prevailing at
    Marshall. Brigadier General Edmund F.L. O'Connor, Director of MSFC's
    Industrial Operations, provided von Braun with some background data
    that included the following judgment: "The S-II program is out of
    control....It is apparent that management of the project at both the
    program level and division level at S&amp;ID has not been
    effective.... In addition to the management problems, there are still

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In an October letter to Harrison Storms, the
    president of S&amp;ID, General O'Connor started with a friendly
    salutation ("Dear Stormy") and ended with assurances that MSFC wanted
    to help wherever possible to get the S-II program back on track. In
    between, the general minced no words. He pointed out that the
    breakdown in the S-II program reflected poorly on both S&amp;ID and
    MSFC's management ability. O'Connor pointed a stern finger at
    S&amp;ID, remarking that he was "most apprehensive" about the entire
    S-II program. "The continued inability or failure of S&amp;ID to
    project with any reasonable accuracy their resource requirements,
    their inability to identify in a timely manner impending problems,
    and their inability to assess and relate resource requirements and
    problem areas to schedule impact, can lead me to only one
    conclusion," O'Connor declared, "that S&amp;ID management does not
    have control of the Saturn S-II program."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> The chief of Marshall's industrial operations also
    conveyed his worry about the troublesome stage to the upper echelons
    of NASA management. Reviewing the problems during the annual program
    review at Headquarters in November, O'Connor noted managerial and
    technical shortcomings at North American and said that MSFC had
    "caused changes to be made in management; some people have been
    moved." In spite of help from the R&amp;D operations laboratories at
    MSFC, problems in welding, inspection, insulation, and component
    qualification still existed, and as a result, the first S-II flight
    stage was more than three months behind schedule. "It is my opinion
    that program management at North American is perhaps the principal
    shortcoming of the entire S-II program," O'Connor
    said.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The upshot of this administrative turbulence
    was the dispatch of a special "Tiger Team," headed by General
    Phillips, from the Apollo Program Office to North American. The Tiger
    Team appellation apparently came out of Phillips's Air Force
    experience-a special, ad hoc investigative group dispatched to dig
    into a problem area and come up with specific recommendations to
    solve the issues. As a later Associate Administrator for Manned Space
    Flight, Dale Myers, commented, "There is a need to terrorize the
    contractor once in a while." The result of that visit to North
    American was the soon-to-be famous Phillips report, which ripped into
    the company's management, not only on the S-II matter, but on the

    Advisory Committee (PSAC), which convened at the Manned Spacecraft
    Center in Houston on 15 0ctober. Since a covey of high-level NASA
    executives was attending, Phillips took advantage of the situation by
    assembling a select group for an intense one-hour session following
    the PSAC sessions. The participants
    [<A NAME="226"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">226</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] included George Mueller, George Loss, and Joe Shea
    from Headquarters, along with Eberhard Rees from MSFC. The issue was
    North American's performance on the S-II. Rees briefed the group on
    plans to send "a group of selected experts from MSFC" to check on
    S&amp;ID's operation on the S-II. The Marshall group, scheduled to
    leave on 18 October, was headed by Colonel Sam Yarchin, the program
    manager at Huntsville. Phillips wanted more than that. Rees reported
    that aside from MSFC's own S-II sleuths, Phillips wanted to take a
    close look at the entire S&amp;ID operation "after Yarchin's
    committee has done some spade work." Phillips advocated a special
    survey team composed of top management from both MSC and MSFC; it was
    agreed to consider the matter in detail when von Braun visited

    their mutual concern that the Apollo program should stay on course to
    a successful conclusion, but stressed severe problems in the rate of
    progress for both the S-II stage and the command and service modules
    (CSM). The purpose of the Phillips visit was to identify "those
    actions that either or both of us should take." General Phillips took
    Joe Shea from NASA Headquarters and Rees and O'Connor from MSFC. The

    Briefly, Phillips told Atwood, "I am definitely not satisfied with
    the progress and outlook of either program.... The conclusions
    expressed in our briefing and notes are critical." The overall report
    was a thorough analysis of S&amp;ID operations with various sub-teams
    investigating management, contracting, engineering. manufacturing,
    and reliability-quality control. Including Yarchin's "spadework" on
    the S-II, completed in early November, the thick document represented
    an almost unrelieved series of pointed criticisms of S&amp;ID.

    measures unless the situation at North American showed distinct
    improvement. On 8 December 1965, he had composed a 13-page
    memorandum, "Personal Impressions, View and Recommendations," based
    on his S&amp;ID reviews from 22 November through 4 December. The
    operation was far too big and bulky, Rees observed, making it
    unwieldy. It needed to be slimmed [<A NAME="227"></A></FONT><B><FONT

    needed to be much more awareness of progress and problems at the

    "Sensitive, very limited MSF and MSFC Distribution," the memo was
    restricted to only three copies: the original to von Braun; one copy
    to Phillips; one copy for Rees's personal files. There were only a
    few encouraging signs at Seal Beach, he observed, and he hoped no
    serious dislocations would occur. Then, in a chillingly prophetic
    premonition, he wrote: "I do not want to elaborate on the possibility
    that we might lose the S-II-T stage by explosion and do heavy damage
    to the only test stand we have so far. But this possibility is not
    zero considering that Douglas blew up the S-IV-T on their stand with

    memo involved S&amp;ID management. Rees expressed continuing
    uncertainty about the ability of Harrison Storms to cope with the
    snowballing costs and technical hangups of the S-II program. Robert
    E. Greer, a Storms aide, was the man to do the job in a crunch, Rees
    felt, and advocated Greer to take over direction of the S-II if
    necessary. MSFC should keep very close watch over S&amp;ID, Rees
    advised, and if their performance did not improve in 1966, then, Rees
    added, "I believe NASA has to resort to very drastic measures." If
    the program still lagged, then NASA "should in all seriousness
    consider whether further S-II's should be contracted with
    NAA-S&amp;ID." The bulk of S-II manufacturing facilities were owned
    by the government and could, if needed, be turned over to another

    company's managerial structure seemed inevitable. Already trying to
    get on the top of the S-II program in 1965, Storms named Robert E.
    Greer, a retired Air Force major general with a lean, Lincolnesque
    aura about him, as his special representative for the S-II. Greer had
    joined the company in July and took this assignment in October. By
    January 1966, in the wake of the [<A NAME="228"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">228</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Phillips report,
    Greer became vice-president and program manager of the S-II program.
    In a somewhat unusual turn of events, the man Greer replaced, Bill
    Parker, stayed on as Greer's deputy. Parker had joined the company in
    1948, serving as S-II program manager since 1961. The company's
    management obviously hoped that Parker's strong background in
    engineering and years of experience inside the company would
    complement Greer's managerial skills, recently honed as Assistant
    Chief of Staff for Guided Missiles at USAF
    Headquarters.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In retrospect, Greer observed that the S-II
    program was indeed in bad shape. Among other things, he said that top
    management had poor visibility, and the lateral flow of information
    seemed to be weak. Greer updated and revitalized his management
    control center to enhance management's overall conception of progress
    (or lack of it) in the S-II program (see </FONT><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="ch9.htm">chapter 9</A></FONT><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> for details on management control centers). He also
    instituted more management meetings, carefully structured to help the
    lateral flow of information, as well as garner intelligence from a
    broader range of sources, vertically as well as laterally. The
    meetings were know at North American as "Black Saturdays." The term
    came from Greer's earlier experience in the Air Force Ballistic
    Missile Division, where the commanding officer, Brigadier General
    Bernard A. Schriever, convened such gatherings once a month. Those
    attending encompassed a broad spectrum of Schriever's command. When a
    program director raised an issue, Schriever wanted to be able to turn
    directly to a staffer or engineer for an answer or advice. When Greer
    took over the S-II program, he also had "Black Saturdays"-except that
    he had them every day, limited to 45 minutes each morning; later he
    cut their frequency to two or three times a week.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For attendees, Greer seemed to "over-invite"
    people, reaching rather far down the management ladder and including
    various technical personnel as well. A wide variety of problems were
    discussed, with planners and assembly-line engineers exchanging
    criticisms and recommendations. The experience spotlighted a lot of
    otherwise hard-to-see conflicts, and certainly improved overall
    visibility and awareness of the S-II's development. Greer made a
    point of personally visiting people at lower echelons of management
    and engineering to enhance employee morale and accumulate additional
    information for himself. In any case, Greer won the respect and
    admiration of many of his contemporaries at North
    American.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.56">56</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, Greer's new administration took
    time to bring all the discordant notes of the S-II program into
    closer harmony. Growing restlessness spread through NASA Headquarters
    as the S-II-1 (the first flight stage) became the pacing item for
    AS-501. Early in 1966, George Mueller pointed out this dubious
    distinction to North American's president, but added a supportive
    note: "Your recent efforts to improve the
    [<A NAME="229"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">229</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] stage schedule position have been most gratifying and
    I am confident that there will be continuing improvement." As it
    turned out, the really difficult problem became the S-II-T, which, at
    the present, was undergoing testing at MTF. In April, one of
    Phillips's envoys at MTF reported serious problems in North
    American's personnel; the veteran group of test people sent to
    Mississippi on a temporary basis had gone back to California, leaving
    inexperienced personnel in charge. On 25 May 1966, one fire near some
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    valves and another in the engine area curtailed a full-duration
    static test, although a successful full-duration (350 + seconds) test
    firing had been accomplished five days earlier. Atwood called von
    Braun to express his concern about the incident. Together, they
    discussed the probable cause, closing with discussion about different
    ways to expedite the program.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On 28 May 1966, a major blow to the Saturn V
    program came with the destruction of the S-II-T, the second S-II
    stage to be lost.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    the fires that occurred during the static tests three days earlier.
    With the LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT

    progress. During prior tests, tank pressure sensors and relief
    switches had been disconnected, a fact unknown to the crew conducting
    the pressure checks, and as a result, the LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> tank was pressurized
    beyond its design limits, ruptured, and was demolished. Five men from
    the North American test crew were injured, and two others were
    hospitalized for observation. The accident occurred on Saturday
    during the Memorial Day weekend. Von Braun had gone to a nearby lake
    for some rest and relaxation, and a distraught Harrison Storms, in
    trying to contact von Braun at home, could only reach von Braun's
    wife. Storms finally contacted von Braun on Tuesday, the day after
    Memorial Day. "I was at the lake," von Braun explained, "and she (my
    wife) told me that you were on the phone with a tear-choked voice."
    Von Braun was both sympathetic and stern. The loss of the S-II-T
    underscored the managerial weaknesses at MTF, he told Storms. With so
    many work shifts on and off the job, it was easy to foul things up.
    The contractor needed more seniority and better procedural control.
    The next day, in a call to Robert Gilruth at Houston, von Braun
    remarked that he saw nothing basically wrong in the design of the
    S-II. Its problems could be traced to management, procedure, and
    human error. The MSFC director summed up his view of the S-II's
    agonies in a terse assessment: "The whole thing is NAA,
    S&amp;ID."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Ripples of the S-II-T's destruction were felt
    in the launch schedule for AS-501; slippage in the S-II-1 flight
    stage had led to plans to use the S-II-T at Cape Kennedy to stack the
    AS-501 vehicle for systems tests and replace it later with the flight
    stage. Investigation of the S-II-T uncovered the presence of tiny
    cracks in the LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> Now, the successful launch of AS-501 depended even
    more heavily on successful testing of the first of the S-II-1 flight
    stages; the latter left Seal Beach on 31 July for a critical series
    of static firing and acceptance tests at MTF. By mid-August, the S-II
    was set up in Test Stand A-2 for checkout prior to static firing,
    which did not occur until the first of December. The intervening time
    was filled with a series of nettling problems-"the continuous
    surprises that keep occurring after the stages arrive on deck at
    MTF," as Rees complained to Storms during one of his weekly
    teleconferences.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">MSFC personnel found faults not only in the
    S-II-1 but in other stages. For example, the second flight stage,
    S-II-2, had been ordered back to the factory for numerous
    modifications and fixes. Many of the same operations had to be
    repeated on other components in various stages of fabrication and
    assembly. Managers at MSFC organized special Tiger Teams of technical
    and test operations personnel, dispatching them to MTF to assist in
    the static firing. All of this did little to cheer up the Apollo
    Program Office in Washington. During a year-end session of the annual
    program review, Phillips, still unhappy, summed up the assorted ills
    and tribulations of the S-II: "The performance of the contractor has
    not measured up to the minimum requirements of this
    program."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With a few perturbations here and there,
    including a major change in the contractor's management, 1967 was a
    year of contrast for the S-II. During January, Phillips reported to
    the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF) that organization and test
    procedures had improved at MTF.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.63">63</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> To cope with the continuing problems at Seal Beach,
    MSFC sent a new Tiger Team, under the leadership of Colonel Yarchin,
    the S-II project manager, to the West Coast. Yarchin and 15
    well-known technicians left early in January. This created questions
    in the aerospace press and elsewhere, about the nature and extent of
    North American's vicissitudes. MSFC prepared a statement as a
    guideline for use in answering questions raised by reporters,
    emphasizing the basic soundness of the S-II design, while admitting
    the need for MSFC's technical assistance in welding and other
    procedures at Seal Beach. By the end of the month, Phillips reported
    to the Associate Administrator that MSFC welding techniques had been
    adopted on the S-II. During March, a welding team from S&amp;ID
    traveled to Marshall to observe techniques for reducing the frequency
    of weld defects in the circumferential welds of the

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Besides the S-II program, the beleaguered
    management at North American was trying to cope with production
    problems and schedule slippages involving the command module. Concern
    for the CM issue [<A NAME="231"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">231</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] caused the Phillips
    team, which descended on North American in 1965, to include more

    responsibility for the CM) than from MSFC.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.65">65</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> Then, tragically on 27 January 1967, a flash fire in
    the CM during prelaunch tests at the Cape claimed the lives of
    astronauts Virgil I. Grissom, Edward White, II, and Roger B. Chaffee.
    The fire exacerbated NASA's concerns about the management structure
    of S&amp;ID. The aftermath of the fire brought reworking of the CM
    and prelaunch test procedures and modification of many schedules. The
    delays, however, aided the Saturn vehicle
    contractors.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.66">66</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> The fire also triggered further reorganization of
    North American, as the company continued to contend with the
    persistent criticism of its performance from NASA. In a series of
    moves announced early in May 1967, company president Atwood
    streamlined S&amp;ID and drastically shuffled his management team.
    The "information systems," part of Space and Information Systems
    Division, was snipped off and spliced into the Autonetics Division at
    Anaheim, leaving Space Division to concentrate on the Apollo program.
    Harrison Storms, relieved as president of S&amp;ID (at Downey),
    became a corporate vice- president, and was replaced by William
    "Bill" Bergen, who had only recently resigned as president of the
    Martin Company, an aerospace firm in Baltimore, Maryland. Bergen was
    given the assistance of some of North American's top executive
    experts. Paul Vogt, newly appointed vice-president in the Space
    Division, had special responsibility for improving engineering,
    manufacturing, and quality control. Ralph H. Ruud, an expert on
    materials and quality control and former corporate vice-president for
    manufacturing, took over as Bergen's executive vice- president. In
    addition, North American management at the Cape was realigned into a
    more unified structure reporting directly to Bastian "Buzz" Hello,
    who came with Bergen from the Martin Company.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the meantime, delivery of the S-II-1 stage
    to the Cape in late January prompted cautious optimism about the
    overall progress for the Saturn booster; this optimism was
    short-lived, clouded by mounting requirements for "open work" on the
    stage, involving modifications to hardware that only recently had
    emerged from production lines. "This growth in modifications
    downstream all the way to the stack at KSC must be arrested," Mueller
    told the president of North American. "We simply must attain early
    definition of the work to be accomplished at the proper station and
    ship complete stages to MTF and KSC."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    "hairline" cracks found in S-II tankage under manufacture led to a
    huddle in Washington on the possibility of similar faults in the
    S-II-1 already stacked with other stages for the AS-501 launch. With
    the launch scheduled for mid-August, individuals meeting at NASA
    Headquarters on the afternoon of 24 May considered the possibility of
    missing the launch date because of the inspection work to be done on
    S-II-1. The top-level decision group, including Phillips,
    [<A NAME="232"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">232</FONT></B><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It would be inaccurate to say that the S-IC
    project waltzed through its development without a stumble. Still,
    there were decidedly fewer traumas with it than with the S-II. The
    S-IC clearly profited from the close association with MSFC's own
    fabrication and manufacturing specialists early in the game. The use
    of conventional propellants like RP-1 and liquid oxygen represented a
    lower magnitude of difficulty in producing tanks and
    accessories.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">North American had trouble with the S-II, at
    least in part, because the company had some management difficulties.
    In fact, the problems, had been growing many months before the crisis
    of 1965-1966. Von Braun's "Daily Journal" expressed concern about
    management shortcomings as early as 1963, citing problems in cost
    overruns and organization of manufacturing units.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#7.71">71</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> Moreover, the S-II program got caught in a
    weight-shaving program, which made working with its extremely
    thin-walled tanks and other lightened hardware even more
    difficult.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The turn-around for the S-II by 1967 resulted
    from the resolute, though agonizing, reorganization of North
    American's management. The reorganization created better visibility
    and more direct interaction between corporate managers and the
    divisions, and benefited from the streamlining of S&amp;ID itself,
    and the ability of Robert Greer. Greer's combination of managerial
    skills and the ability to come to terms with the technical problems
    commanded the respect, loyalty, and performance from North American's
    workers at a crucial time. North American was competent to do the
    job; reorganization and tighter management enabled North American's
    capabilities to be applied more effectively.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Finally, the influence from NASA Headquarters
    and from MSFC was extremely significant. The thorough assessment by
    the Phillips team influenced North American's realignment in the
    right direction. Added to this was the impact of various technical
    teams from MSFC dispatch to Seal Beach and MTF to help solve
    perplexing hardware problems and operational snarls. Sometimes this
    was a hindrance. In Greer's opinion, Marshall's ubiquitous engineers
    and direction from Huntsville reach the point where North American's
    attempts to catch up were snarled by NASA's red
