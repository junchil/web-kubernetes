    FACE="Geneva">xv</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The gigantic Saturn
    V launch vehicle may well be the first and last of its kind.
    Subsequent space ventures will be based on new vehicles, such as the
    smaller, reusable Space Shuttle. Manned launches in the near future
    will be geared to orbital missions rather than planetary excursions,
    and unmanned deep-space missions will not demand the very high thrust
    boosters characteristic of the Apollo program. As the space program
    moves into the future, it also appears that the funding for elaborate
    "big booster" missions will not be forthcoming for NASA. The Saturn V
    class of launch vehicles are the end of the line of the Saturn
    generation. It is not likely that anything like them will ever be
    built again.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Because of the commanding drama of the awesome
    Saturn V, it is easy to forget the first Saturn-the Saturn I and
    Saturn IB. This history is an attempt to give due credit to these
    pioneering vehicles, to analyze the somewhat awkward origins of the
    Saturn I as a test bed for static testing only, not as an operational
    vehicle, and to discuss the uprated Saturn IB as an interim booster
    for the orbital testing of the first Apollo capsules. Evolution of
    the engines is also given considerable space early in the narrative.
    Because the Apollo-Saturn program was expected to put a man on the
    moon within a fixed time span, the use of available hardware was
    particularly attractive-an aspect of the program that is not
    generally appreciated by the public. The development of the early
    Saturn I and IB vehicles, as well as the engines, illustrates this
    approach. Inevitably, the unique nature of the mission called for
    advances in the state of the art, and the Saturn history includes
    some examples. One outstanding example is the development of
    high-energy liquid hydrogen engines. Other examples include the
    development of insulation for extended storage of large quantities of
    hydrogen in vehicle tanks and the advances in the computer technology
    of the guidance and control systems.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The development of Saturn was enormously
    expensive and time- consuming. Even given the expected costs of
    developments to advance the state of the art, why were the costs of
    the development time so great if [<A NAME="xvi"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">xvi</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] the program still
    relied so much on existing hardware? Part of the answer involves the
    uniqueness of dimensions. Even a proven component, to be used in the
    huge Saturn, had to be scaled up in size. The larger component had to
    withstand a similar increase in the amount of punishment inflicted on
    it, and this fact opened up a whole new regime of operational
    headaches. The scaling up of components and systems for lunar
    missions seemed to involve geometrical progressions rather than
    simple arithmetic progressions. The F-1 engines for the S-IC first
    stage graphically illustrate this difficulty. The size of the Saturn
    stages and engines also called for enlargement of test stands and
    other facilities, with attendant increases in time and costs. The
    logistical challenge assumed gargantuan proportions. The managers of
    the Apollo-Saturn programs also discovered unanticipated expenses in
    storing and maintaining exotic hardware that was subject to
    degradation unless constantly monitored, refurbished, and attended by
    additional cadres of technicians.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This book is a technological history. To many
    contemporaries the narrative may read too much like a technical
    manual, but the author's concern is for posterity, when the technical
    manuals may be lost or dispersed (as many are already) and
    knowledgeable participants have long since died. The narrative
    approach was largely predicated on questions that might well be asked
    by future generations: How were the Saturns made? How did they work?
    Two other histories, already published, deal with subjects keyed to
    the Apollo-Saturn program: (1) the development of the Apollo command
    and service modules along with the lunar module, and (2) the
    construction and operation of launch facilities at Cape Kennedy.
    These books contain much of the political and administrative
    struggles surrounding the origins and development of the Apollo
    program, and it would be redundant to retell the whole story for the
    Saturn history. I have therefore included only the background that
    seemed necessary to put the Saturn in proper perspective, and Part
    Two recapitulates the programmatic and administrative origins of
    Saturn. The bulk of the text is devoted to the theme of technological
    development. Even chapter 9, on management, is geared to the
    specifics of the technological management of Saturn vehicles.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The decision to treat the history of the
    Saturn program as a technological narrative shaped the nature of all
    sections of the book. So that some of the innovations and advances
    might be appreciated, it seemed advisable to include a brief
    historical overview of rocket technology. Against this background, I
    hope the Saturn story will stand out with greater clarity.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The narrative itself is organized into seven
    parts. The question was how to deal with the complexity of many
    simultaneous programs during the Saturn development that involved the
    various engines, stages, and associated equipment for three separate
    launch vehicles. A strict chronological organization seemed
    unnecessarily confusing. The topical approach,
    [<A NAME="xvii"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">xvii</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] although
    constructed in a loose chronological sequence, provided the
    opportunity to deal with the early technology involved in Saturn I
    and Saturn IB launch vehicles primarily in terms of the concept of
    clustering tanks and engines. The engines themselves, although they
    possessed inherent differences, evolved out of common principles of
    engine design and cryogenic technology. Dealing with these propulsion
    systems as a separate unit made the significance of their development
    stand out more clearly. Similarly, I analyzed the evolution of rocket
    stages as a unit and emphasized propellant tankage for the Saturn V
    vehicle. Although many early Saturn flights were concurrent with the
    research and development phases, all the launches are summarized in
    two chapters toward the end of the book. Just as the flights were the
    culmination of Apollo-Saturn, discussion of them all at the end of
    the narrative seemed logical.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The manned operations involving the
    spacecraft-the activities of the launch crews at liftoff-the role of
    the astronauts-these events involved discrete numbers of human
    actors. The inherent drama in launches and missions tended to
    spotlight the people involved. On the other hand, development of the
    Saturn launch vehicle rested on millions of hours of prior research
    and development and on thousands of designers, engineers,
    technicians, and specialists who worked behind the scenes. It was
    often impossible to single out a specific individual responsible for
    a specific achievement because most of the major decisions and
    breakthroughs resulted from elaborate team efforts. In fact, one
    veteran of the Marshall Space Flight Center told me that he preferred
    that the Saturn history not mention people at all. It was too hard,
    he explained, to isolate significant achievements without mentioning
    dozens of people who made successful contributions,</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The launch vehicle, as dramatic as it was
    during liftoff, played a minor role in the total duration of a
    mission. It was visible to observers for only eight minutes or so as
    it blazed into orbit. The personnel of Houston's Mission Control and
    the astronaut crew occupied center stage for the lion's share of the
    lunar mission. For all the spectacular effects of the Saturn
    vehicle's awesome launch, most of the Saturn story deals with many
    years of unglamorous research, development, and test. It is a story
    of prior work: of nuts, bolts, and pyrotechnics-and that is the story
    I have tried to tell in these pages.</FONT></P>
