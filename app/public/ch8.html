    II, the growing sophistication of weapon systems and communications
    equipment prompted development of test procedures to ensure that
    everything was in proper working order. Automatic testing, or
    checkout, saved time and reduced the large number of specialists who
    would otherwise have to be trained to do the job. In the post-World
    War II era, larger and ever more complex missile systems created new
    difficulties in testing and monitoring the internal condition of the
    missile. Computers were introduced not only to measure the level of
    fuel and oxidizer in the tanks, but also to assess propellant
    qualities such as temperature, stratification, and boil-off rates.
    Continuous monitoring of the condition of propellant machinery,
    missile electronics, and various internal rocket systems became
    significant functions of computer check-out. The Atlas, the first
    American ICBM, used the kind of comprehensive checkout equipment that
    would be elaborated in the course of the Apollo-Saturn program. Once
    launched, rockets like the Atlas needed precise guidance and control.
    Other, smaller computers and associated equipment aboard the vehicle
    maintained the proper course and controlled the flow of propellants.
    Again, the Apollo-Saturn elaborated on equipment developed for
    ICBMs.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    according to one definition, "when it can, to some degree,
    autonomously sequence a series [<A NAME="236"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">236</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] of measurements of
    equipment outputs and comparisons of these measurements against
    standards." A manual test system, on the other hand, required the
    operator to switch the equipment from one reading to a different one
    and to make comparisons on "go/no-go" conditions. For NASA engineers,
    the intricacy and enormity of measurement and comparison was evident
    by taking a look at the number of comparison test points in the
    Apollo-Saturn vehicle. Vanguard, produced by Martin, required only
    about 600 test points. The Apollo spacecraft, on the other hand,
    included over 2500 test points on the command module and the lunar
    module, and another 5000 on the Saturn itself. Further, these test
    points were checked and monitored constantly from early manufacturing
    checkout sequences, to pre-static-firing checkout, to
    post-static-firing checkout. Test points were checked scores of times
    in the 12-14 weeks required prior to a launch for complete checkout
    of the Apollo-Saturn stack at Cape Kennedy. Without computer
    technology, such procedures, even at the launch site, might have
    stretched out the checkout procedures for more than a
    year.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    point of merely pinpointing a fault in the equipment. The automaticd
    checkout paraphernalia associated with the Apollo-Saturn program
    additionally incorporated a diagnosis function; computer or screen

    only that a problem existed, but also the nature of the problem, its

    creation of a new language. The language tapes incorporated in the

    make sense to persons reworking the piece of hardware that failed or

    individuals came to the language problem from a different background
    and with a different goal in mind. Melding two such disciplines
    together was not always an easy task. Earlier in the Saturn program,
    Marshall Space Flight Center had developed two separate languages for
    computer operations-one for stage testing and one for launch site
    operations. This situation obviously created communications problems
    and was complicated by the fact that each of the stage manufacturers
    was also using its own computer language based on the particular
    requirements of its own test designers and engineers. A further
    entanglement involved the rapid evolution of checkout programs. Test
    engineers were putting new demands on the computers, and these new
    demands as well as the style of language had to be communicated to
    the programmer. To arrive at an appropriate language, either the test
    engineer had to learn more about programming, or the programmer had
    to learn more about test engineering. The solution to this dilemma
    was ATOLL, an acronym for Acceptance Test or Launch Language,
    designed to bridge many of the gaps between the test engineer, the
    designer of the stage, and the computer programmer. Originating in
    late 1963, ATOLL eased confusion and helped to normalize the many
    functions of automatic test and checkout encountered at the
    manufacturer's plant, during static firing, and during operations at
    the launch site.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In a typical test sequence a number of things
    happened. For example, the test engineer inaugurated the program by
    typing in the instructions on his console. The computer responded by
    reading out for the test engineer the status of the selected program.
    When the program was ready for running, this was indicated on the
    appropriate panel of the computer. The information appeared in
    English on either the cathode tube of the program display or on a
    video data terminal. Perhaps the display also included numerous
    options for the engineer, depending on which portions of the test he
    wanted to pursue at the time. If some selected part of the test
    required a further breakdown for the engineer's consideration,
    instructions could also be typed in, and the computer would respond
    on the display tube. When either programming difficulties or hardware
    problems cropped up, the computer might give the test engineer a
    choice of several actions: terminate the test, go back to a prior
    enumerated step, proceed, or some other option. Further, in the
    process of running the test, all the results were shown on
    engineering display consoles and recorded both in print and on
    magnetic tape. These readouts were stored and, in some instances,
    were correlated into previous test operations for checking at some
    later date. Thereafter, if an anomaly occurred, it was possible to
    run a check through the computer all the way back to the machine shop
    floor to see what discrepancies or difficulties might have occurred
    in the test conditions, hardware, or in the manufacturing process
    itself.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    static-firing program (and before any mating of the separate stages
    occurred), each Saturn stage had to pass checkout requirements.
    Although the final test goals were similar for each stage, the
    differences between stages required a "custom-tailored" test for each
    one. Designing a checkout system to satisfy the unique requirements
    of the instrument unit and each stage, and also meet integrated
    vehicle requirements, became what MSFC called a "major task." The
    Marshall group drew on its experience with the Redstone, Jupiter,
    Mercury, Saturn I, and other rocket programs in establishing the
    checkout organization.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For the Saturn program, checkout included two
    distinct phases. "Stage checkout" included test sequences conducted
    on the individual stage during manufacturing and static firing prior
    to NASA's acceptance for assembly into the launch vehicle. "Vehicle
    checkout" included tests on the assembled launch vehicle at the
    launch site. A complete checkout of the stack was deemed necessary
    because an individual stage might function perfectly in tests that
    simulated interaction with other stages, but not function as well
    when linked together physically in the stack.
    [<A NAME="239"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">239</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] Marshall's main interest was the actual stage
    checkout, with responsibility for final launch vehicle checkout
    resting with Kennedy Space Center. Originally, NASA planners
    envisioned repeating the stage checkout after the delivery of each
    stage to Cape Kennedy, but it became apparent that this scheme
    compromised the time and resources required for final checkout and
    launch. Therefore each stage received final checkout before transport
    to the launch site. The procedure not only made it easier to
    accomplish the final checkout and launch, but enabled MSFC and the
    contractors to deal more efficiently with problem areas at the stage
    test facility (where specialized personnel and equipment were
    present). This concept paid off on the first three Saturn V vehicles
    when stage checkouts uncovered 40 serious defects; these flaws would
    have gone undetected had the stage checkout depended only on
    procedures and facilities available at the launch
    site.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Each booster stage was subjected to a
    post-manufacturing checkout, a checkout prior to static-firing tests,
    and a post-static-firing checkout. Static firing, the most dramatic
    test, tested the propulsion systems during actual ignition and
    operation. Checkout featured a "building-block" sequence, common to
    all stages, with variations as necessary for an individual stage. A
    typical sequence began with an independent electrical system test and
    was followed by a simplified rundown of the launch sequence. Next,
    other systems were run in succession; guidance and control system
    tests; a second launch sequence run with these and other electrical
    and propulsion systems tested; completion of ancillary system tests;
    an all-systems test; and, finally, a "simulated flight" test,
    including ignition and a duration burn.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Saturn stages and the associated checkout
    equipment for each were developed simultaneously with the goal of an
    integrated design of the vehicle and its ground equipment. Some of
    the vehicle's mechanical equipment-such as sensing equipment for
    checkout of a number of items operated by fluid, as well as fluid
    management subsystems-did not lend themselves to checkout with
    digital computers. Design engineers succeeded in developing suitable
    checkout equipment for the electrically actuated and measured
    equipment so that the great majority of stage checkout tests would
    proceed automatically. The Saturn I vehicles offered the first
    experiences in stage checkout for Saturn class vehicles. Whereas the
    vehicle SA-1 required manual checkout, by the end of the Saturn
    series automatic equipment controlled over 50 percent of the tests.
    The automatic capability improved during the S-IB vehicle series, ad
    checkout of the Saturn V stages, including the instrument unit (IU),
    was about 90 percent automaticd.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Checkout equipment for S-II and S-IVB stages
    of the Saturn V was developed by the stage contractors under the
    direction of MSFC. For the S-IC, Marshall collaborated with Boeing in
    developing the automaticd equipment, because the first S-IC stages
    were fabricated in MSFC shops [<A NAME="240"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">240</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] at Huntsville.
    Boeing employees trained on the first two S-IC stages at Huntsville,
    then checked out later stages at Michoud. For the IU, checkout
    equipment previously developed by Marshall for the Saturn I was
    utilized, with IBM in Huntsville assuming responsibility for later
    work. The S-IC stage and the IU checkout operations both utilized the
    RCA-110A digital computer. NASA had already decided to use the
    RCA-110A for launch control, so the interfaces with the S-IC and IU
    were compatible. In contrast, the S-II and S-IVB stages relied on the
    CDC-924A computer, supplied by Control Data Corporation. The design
    of the computer offered added flexibility for checkout of the two
    upper stages, which utilized liquid hydrogen as fuel, mounted the J-2
    engine, ignited at high altitude, and included several unique design
    features. Also the CDC-924A, which was based on later-generation
    computer technology, offered added test
    functions.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> The Saturn program also relied heavily on the "Saturn
    V Systems Breadboard," a facility located at MSFC. The breadboard
    incorporated both mechanical equipment and electronic simulation and
    was used for wringing out the checkout procedures and launch control
    operations at the Cape.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    preeminence of automation. Many of Douglas's own people opposed the
    ubiquitous computer. "In fact," an automation expert at Douglas
    admitted, "the company was surprised to find that its equipment took
    the automation more readily than did its
    engineers."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the pre-Saturn days of rocket and missile
    operations, many checkout procedures were performed manually and
    worked well with complex vehicles like the Thor-Delta. Douglas
    engineers used manual checkout techniques for the earliest S-IV
    stages; pre-checkout, acceptance firing, and post-checkout required a
    total of 1200 hours per stage. Veteran "switch flippers," who for so
    long scanned gauges and dials, flipping the right switch in a
    critical situation, had been vital links in the overall loop. They
    were now replaced by ranks of gray-enameled computers. For checkout
    procedures on the Saturn V third stage, the S-IVB, fully automaticd
    techniques replaced the manual checkout for the first time. Although
    the magnitude of testing rose by 40 percent per stage, the new
    automaticd systems reduced the checkout time to about 500 hours
    total. H. E. Bauer clearly remembered the occasion when men and the
    new machines first confronted each other. "One seasoned switch
    flipper came into the blockhouse after the equipment was installed;
    he watched the blinking lights, the scanners, the recorders-
    everything was working automatically, heaving out wide and endless
    runs of data printouts...." The man balefully surveyed the
    mechanically throbbing interloper and growled. "It's the Gray Puke!"
    It was not an isolated reaction. As Bauer recalls, the ghastly name
    stuck and became part of the permanent lexicon associated with the
    S-IVB stage.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even with mechanical drones like the Gray Puke
    usurping the [<A NAME="241"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">241</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] human role, the
    man-behind-the-machine could still display some semblance of
    individuality. Consider, for example, the case of the petulant
    computer-printer-when the machine apparently took umbrage during the
    automatic checkout sequence in preparation for an acceptance firing.
    The moment of truth for the test arrived-the signal to fire. After
    uncounted hours of preparation, hundreds of workers now stood by to
    observe the climactic moment of ignition. In the crowded blockhouse,
    all eyes focused on the rows of computers and monitor screens
    displaying their last fragments of information. Finally, the test
    conductor typed in his "request" to start the terminal countdown for
    static firing. The computer whirred, and the automatic typewriter
    responded with a singular reply, "Say please." Startled, the test
    conductor concluded he had made a typing error, and repeated his
    original message more carefully. The balky computer was not to be
    denied. "Say please," it insisted. At this point the crowd in the
    blockhouse began stirring restlessly. The loaded S-IVB, readied for
    firing, remained poised nearby with thousands of gallons of liquid
    oxygen and liquid hydrogen primed for detonation. People were getting
    tense. Reasonably certain he was only working against a faulty firing
    tape, the test conductor quickly decided to make one more try, rather
    than put it into discard and risk more precious time to put a
    replacement tape into operation. So once more, he entered into the
    machine his humble request to fire, with a polite notation at the
    end: "please." This time, there was no problem. "This is your
    programmer," the machine chattered back, "wishing you good luck." And
    with a roar, the rocket ignited.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    individual stages, involving thousands of workers and millions of
    man-hours, most of the responsibility for the six-hour flight of a
    Saturn V devolved on a piece of equipment known as the instrument
    unit-the "IU." A thin, circular structure, only 1 meter high and 7.6
    meters in diameter, the IU was sandwiched between the S-IVB stage and
    the command and service modules. Packed inside were the computers,

    journeys overland, where familiar landmarks were unavailable, and
    extensive sea voyages, out of sight of any landmarks at all, came to
    rely on guidance instruments such as compasses and the astrolabe.
    Rocket vehicles, on the other hand, with their extremely high speeds,
    altitudes, and long-range capabilities, came to depend on advanced
    guidance systems coupled with control systems that were essentially
    automatic. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Saturn rockets relied on inertial
    guidance, involving a rigid member within the vehicle. This member,
    an integral element of the guidance package, was oriented and held
    unchanging by means of gyro units, gimbal systems, and
    servomechanisms. Additional equipment tied into the inertial guidance
    unit contained all the data needed to sense the distance traveled by

    the Saturn program involved many problems. Successful solutions were
    reached partly through new research and development and partly
    through the use of proven techniques and hardware adapted from
    existing systems. The Saturn digital computer and the data adapter
    stand out as new developments. The inertial platform, on the other
    hand, was a result of concepts and hardware worked out in the late
    1930s and early 1940s in Germany.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Inertial guidance rested on the technology of
    precision gyroscopes. Gyroscope technology progressed considerably
    during World War I, based on requirements for controlling the gunfire
    of long-range naval guns at sea. During the 1920s and the 1930s,
    further development of gyroscopic systems involved aircraft
    applications, which included rate-of-turn indicators, the artificial
    horizon, and the directional gyro. Despite the remarkable advances in
    aviation guidance instruments for navigation and "blind flying,"
    instrument precision and response rates were inadequate for
    application in high-speed rocket vehicles. New developments were
    required in gimbal systems, servomechanisms, electronics, computers,
    and other equipment leading to inertial guidance systems for rockets
    and missiles. An intensive effort to perfect such hardware occurred
    in the late 1930s and during World War II, particularly through the
    work accomplished in missile research by the von Braun team in
    Germany. C. Stark Draper, a leading postwar specialist in the field
    of guidance and control, acknowledged the contributions of the von
    Braun team in no uncertain terms. "Beyond doubt," he declared,
    "credit for the realization of inertial guidance belongs to the
    Peenemuende group of German scientists who developed the V-2

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the A-4 missile (the V-2), a pair of gyros
    was used in a guidance system known as the LEV-3; one free gyro
    controlled roll and yaw, one controlled pitch, and a tilt program put
    the missile into the proper angular attitude after its vertical
    launch. The LEV-3 employed a gyro-type accelerometer as a propulsion
    cutoff system, the device being preset
    [<A NAME="243"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">243</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] to cut off the engines when the missile reached a
    predetermined velocity. With this pair of two-degree-of-freedom
    gyros, the LEV-3 was a three-axis-stabilized platform (an inertial
    guidance concept), the result of very high quality research and
    development in precision machinery, materials, advanced theory, and
    innovative design concepts. Moreover, the whole system was
    manufactured in quantity.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> One of the most significant developments occurred
    through the work of Fritz Mueller, at Kreissel Geralte GMB. H. This
    was the SG-66, a three-axis platform with advanced accelerometers and
    integrators. Boasting much improved precision and accuracy, it was
    coming into production for use in German missile systems when the war
    ended. After the von Braun group moved to Huntsville, Mueller
    directed further refinements of advanced V-2 guidance concepts
    developed at Peenemuende which ultimately resulted in a far superior
    piece of equipment. The new variant featured an air-bearing system
    for three single-degree-of-freedom gyros integrated in a gimbal-ring
    structure; this yielded a three-axis stabilized platform. Further
    work by other Peenemuende veterans and an analog guidance computer
    devised with American researchers at the Redstone Arsenal culminated
    in the ST-80, the stabilized platform, inertial guidance system
    installed in the Army's 1954 Redstone missile. Prior to launch, the
    intended flight profile was fed into the missile's computer guidance
    program. During flight the ST-8O combined with the guidance computer
    kept the missile on its preplanned trajectory with no external
    guidance influences.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The ST-8O of the Redstone evolved into
    Jupiter's ST-90 (1957); both were turned over to the Ford Instrument
    Company for manufacture. When the Saturn I began to evolve, the Army
    Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) guidelines called for the use of
    proven and available hardware wherever possible. For example, the
    early Saturns incorporated the ST-90 stabilized platform with an IBM

    concurrent with the Saturn I. On 15 June 1961, the mockup of the IU
    was completed at Huntsville and scheduled to fly in the Block II
    series of the Saturn launch vehicles.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> For the Block I vehicles with dummy upper stages,
    guidance and control equipment was packaged in canisters located at
    various points in the adapter area atop the S-I first stage of the
    Saturn I. This equipment included telemetry, tracking, and other
    components, such as the ST-90 guidance platform and a guidance signal
    processor. Plans called for an additional canister to carry the
    ST-124 platform as a "passenger," thus beginning its sequential tests
    and qualification as the active guidance component for later Saturn
    I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V flights.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">MSFC intended to make the ST-124 an
    increasingly active system for SA-5 and subsequent vehicles and to
    link it with an IBM computer. SA-5 was the first of the Block II
    vehicles of the Saturn I series. It featured a live S-IV upper stage
    and a separate vehicle segment, locate above the S-IV, for guidance
    and control (to be known as the IU). Standing about 1.5 meters high,
    the cylindrical IU section contained four package bays that had been
    shaped in the form of large tubes and cruciformly joined in the
    center. This new structural element was
    [<A NAME="245"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">245</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] designed for greater flexibility and permitted
    modifications between launches, if so dictated by results of the
    previous launch and changing test requirements. The four tubular
    segments contained the ST-90, the ST-124, the telemetry equipment,
    and the power and control package.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With the flight of SA-9, the Saturn I vehicles
    began carrying a new type of instrument unit, which resembled the
    equipment later applied in the Saturn IB and Saturn V flights. In the
    earlier design, the tubular package bays were pressurized and
    surrounded by an inert gas as a means of environmental control to
    cope with the problems of heat. In later instrument unit design,
    however, equipment was mounted on the walls of the cylindrical
    segment. With this design the cylindrical unit was not pressurized,
    and the external style of environmental control by inert gas gave way
    to a revised system. Elimination of the pressurized tubular sections
    and other simplifications not only reduced the weight of the
    instrument unit, but also reduced the height of the segment by half,
    thereby improving the structural and flight characteristics of the
    late Block II launch vehicles. Introduction of the improved
    instrument unit marked growing participation of contractors,
    including the Bendix Corporation, for the ST-124, and IBM, who
    assumed increasing responsibility for the instrument unit segment and
    various guidance components.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The major role of IBM as the principal
    manufacturer for the instrument unit began in February 1964. The
    company was named prime contractor for both the Saturn IB and Saturn
    V versions of the IU and was responsible for building, testing, and
    shipping the instrument unit to Cape Kennedy. With MSFC retaining
    primary responsibility for the buildup of the first four units and
    the first four flights of the Saturn IB, IBM was able to ease into
    its work. For the first instrument unit, 80 percent of the hardware
    was classed as government-furnished equipment; this was reduced to 10
    percent when IBM took over for the fifth unit. The instrument unit
    for the Saturn V was essentially the same as the model for the Saturn
    IB, because the evolutionary process of development and manufacturing
    was intended to give the Saturn V a proven piece of equipment with as
    few changes as possible.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    Although the company started with only a sales office building in
    Huntsville in 1962 and originally assumed most of its work would be
    done in New York, the scope of work implied a need for new
    facilities, and IBM decided on a complex in Huntsville. By 1964, IBM
    completed a manufacturing building in Huntsville's Research Park, and

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The ground rules for the design, research, and
    development of the IU came out of MSFC, and these concepts carried
    over into the production models delivered by IBM. With cost
    constraints and tight schedules limiting the number of test flights,
    the number of measurements for each flight was expected to be quite
    high and to vary considerably from one flight to another. For this
    reason, flexibility for the instrument unit had a high priority and
    designers emphasized a modular approach as means to provide both
    flexibility and ease of servicing. Another strongly emphasized
    feature was reliability; a key factor, particularly because the
    Saturn program was geared to manned launches. In addition, liability
    was enforced by the high cost of each vehicle and limited test
    flights, which naturally produces a reluctance to fly exotic,
    untried, hardware. As James T. Powell, of Marshall's Astrionics
    Laboratory stressed, "We simply cannot afford the time or money to
    launch additional vehicles to obtain data lost by instrumentation
    equipment failures. This has led to a rather conservative approach to
    system design." Some innovations, such as new modulation techniques
    or micro-miniaturization, might turn out to be "equivalent in
    importance to the invention of the wheel," Powell remarked, but would
    not be used in the Saturn program until they had undeniably
    demonstrated their operational reliability.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    major rocket stages stacked beneath it and thousands of kilograms of
    spacecraft, lunar landing module (and three astronauts) to support
    above it. The process of assembly of the IU began with three curved
    (120&#176;) structural segments made of thin aluminum sheets bonded
    over an aluminum honeycomb core (approximately equal to the thickness
    of a bar of soap). In joining the three segments together, workers
    used highly accurate theodolites, much like a surveyor's transit, to
    align the three segments in a precise circle. Technicians joined the
    segments with precision-machined splice plates and affixed aluminum
    alloy channel rings for surface mating of both the S-IVB below and

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The key items for guidance and control
    included the ST-124 stabilized platform, the launch vehicle digital
    computer, and the launch vehicle data adapter. Produced by the
    Navigation and Control Division of the Bendix Corporation, the ST-124
    consisted of a three-degrees-of freedom inertial platform. With a
    diameter of 53 centimeters and a weight of 52 kilograms, the
    platform's structural members and most of its components were
    fabricated of beryllium, an extremely lightweight space-age metal.
    Although difficult to work with, beryllium offered significant weight
    savings and provided good stability over a wide temperature range. To
    reduce errors in sensing attitude and velocity, designers cut
    friction to a minimum in the platform gyros and accelerometers by
    floating the bearings on a thin film of dry nitrogen; pressure,
    temperature, and rate of flow were controlled from a reservoir in the
    IU. The carefully controlled alignment of the ST-124 platform did not
    take place until the final events of the launch countdown. The
    procedure called for a precisely sited theodolite not far from the
    launch pad to aim a beam of light through a small opening in the IU
    high above the ground. The beam passed through a small window in the
    guidance platform where a pair of platform prisms reflected the beam
    back to the theodolite. Coated to work with two different
    wavelengths, the prisms aided in aligning the platform to its launch
    azimuth; when proper alignment was achieved, the acquisition light
    signal notified the mission control center.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">All the carefully engineered complexities of
    the Saturn guidance and control system were not fully employed during
    the first-stage burn. Although the ST-124 was released from its
    Earth-fixed reference to a space-fixed reference five seconds before
    liftoff and was supplying velocity and attitude data to the guidance
    computer during the first-stage burn, the vehicle did not require an
    active guidance system during the [<A NAME="249"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">249</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] boost phase. In
    ascent through the atmosphere, both the Saturn IB and Saturn V were
    subject to possible sudden stresses from gusts, wind shear, and jet
    streams. If the guidance computer, acting on signals from the
    stabilized platform, attempted to generate compensation maneuvers
    during such turbulence, the added stress forces from the powerful
    engines as they went through extensive gimbaling motions might cause
    the rocket to break up. So, during the first-stage burn, the rocket
    flew according to a predetermined program stored in its guidance
    computer. If the vehicle was forced off its predetermined path, the
    ST-124 sensed this displacement and fed the data into the computer
    for later retrieval. During the second- and third-stage burns, the
    stored data were run through the computer and into the active
    guidance and control system to put the rocket back on
    course.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Information on yaw, pitch, roll, and
    acceleration provided by the ST-124, as well as inputs from other
    electrical systems, were collectively assimilated and processed by
    the digital computer and the data adapter to give the rocket an
    optimum performance. There was a division of labor involved. The
    computer took information and provided commands such as orbital
    checkout of the vehicle. The adapter performed as an input-output
    unit in conjunction with the digital computer, interfacing with
    nearly all units of the astrionics system. Its digital section
    "buffered" the digital quantities, and an analog section converted
    analog to digital form and back again. The IU equipment for Saturn V
    was only slightly heavier and larger than that for the Saturn I, but
    its computer-data adapter combination was three times faster,
    possessed four times the storage capacity, and was far more reliable.
    Although there were seven times the number of electronic components
    in the Saturn V versions, their total power consumption was 100 watts
    less than in the Saturn I. Furthermore, the 460 000-bit storage
    design could be easily doubled by plugging in additional memory
    modules. The following table offers a quick

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These statistical improvements do more than
    illustrate the significant changes in the IU for the Saturn IB/V, as
    compared with the Saturn [<A NAME="250"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">250</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] I. They also reveal
    that, although original guidelines called for as little new equipment
    as possible, the nature of manned missions and the quest for
    reliability called for advanced design techniques. To meet the
    stringent reliability and operational requirements and also remain
    within the rigid size and weight limitations, four new design
    concepts were incorporated into the computer: a duplex memory system,
    unit logic devices, triple modular redundancy, and a liquid-cooled
    magnesium-lithium chassis.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#8.32">32</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The duplex memory system incorporated two
    separate sets of memory systems that operated in harmony during
    critical phases of the mission. This not only reduced the chances of
    system failure but operated so that one memory system could correct
    the other if intermittent failure should occur. The system consisted
    of six modules operating as pairs of duplex memories, each with 4096
    computer words of 28 bits and designed to accept two additional
    modules for special mission requirements. The unit logic devices
    featured microminiature circuitry, resulting in a smaller, lighter
    system, having seven times more components than earlier computers
    while operating at three times the speed. Typically, each unit logic
    device was produced as a "wafer," 7.6 millimeters square and 0.71
    millimeters thick. A total of 8918 such wafers were mounted on dozens
    of "pages," about 7.6 centimeters square, in the computer.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Further, the IU featured the first computer
    application where all critical circuits in both the computer and data
    adapter were triplicated- triple modular redundancy-giving
    near-ultimate operative reliability. Designers selected seven
    functional sections where catastrophic failure might occur but, for
    reasons of reliability, could not be permitted to occur. Each
    selected section was then placed in three identical but independent
    logic channels. Problems were presented to each module
    simultaneously, and the results of each, independently derived, went
    to a majority-rule voter circuit. Any dissenting "vote" was discarded
    as an error, and the only signal passed along by the voter circuit
    consisted of the identical signals from two of the modules. Voting
    disagreements did not appreciably slow the system: a worst-case
    voting delay would tie up the computer for only 100 nanoseconds
    (billionths of a second). Moreover, the computer unit, occupying 0.6
    cubic meter and weighing 35 kilograms, could subtract and add (in 82
    microseconds) while simultaneously dividing and multiplying (in 328
    microseconds).</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The unusually light weight of the computer was
    achieved by the use of a magnesium-lithium alloy chassis, the first
    application of this alloy in structural fabrication for an
    electronics application. Weight being extremely costly in the upper
    stages of a booster, MSFC used the magnesium-lithium alloy
    construction, along with an integral cooling system, to save 29
    kilograms. In selecting a suitable material, designers turned down
    the [<A NAME="251"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">251</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] even lighter
    beryllium because of toxicity and technical difficulties in machining
    and boring. Magnesium-lithium was still quite light (25 percent less
    than conventional magnesium and 50 percent less than aluminum) and
    possessed a very high weight-to-strength ratio, good thermal
    qualities for operation in space, and minimal transfer of mechanical
    vibration.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to sharing with the computer sonic
    similarities in the fabrication and production of the chassis, the
    data adapter incorporated concepts similar to those of the computer's
    unit logic devices and triple modular redundancy. The basic function
    of the data adapter was that of a "gateway" to the computer for all
    elements of the Saturn guidance system. It received inputs from the
    ground control computer, radio command channel, telemetry,
    multifarious communications from within the vehicle, the inertial
    guidance platform, and the flight control computer. For example,
    analog inputs from various sensors were taken by the data adapter and
    digitized for the computer. Computer outputs were relayed back to the
    data adapter for conversion to analog signals as required. If the
    signals involved control commands, they went through the analog
    flight control computer and were combined with additional signals
    from the rate gyros. The resulting output included commands to
    activate the engine gimbal systems, thereby changing the direction of
    their thrust and the attitude of the launch
    vehicle.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While some IU equipment maintained the rocket
    in flight, other systems were involved in communications, tracking
    the booster in trajectory and orbit, and transmitting reams of data
    back to the ground. Several tracking and command systems were
    employed: an Azusa system measured slant range and vehicle direction
    in relation to ground stations; a C-band radar transponder aided
    radar ground stations in measuring azimuth, elevation, and range; and
    a command and communications system permitted updating of the
    computer, performance of tests, addition or deletion of certain
    messages, and recall of certain portions of the computer memory bank.
    During launch and orbital phases, transducers throughout the vehicle
    reported information on vibrations, pressures, temperatures, and
    various operations; the measuring and telemetry system transmitted
    these data to ground stations. This not only furnished real-time data
    on vehicle performance during the mission but provided a means of
    checkout for succeeding events, verified commands to the vehicle, and
    created a bank of data for later analysis of the vehicle's overall
    performance.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The power to run this complex electronic
    equipment emanated from four 28-volt DC batteries, which consisted of
    special distributors and regulators for both low-voltage components
    and higher currents for the ST-124 inertial platform. The electrical
    system also included the emergency detection network to analyze
    vehicle malfunctions. Depending [<A NAME="252"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">252</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] on the seriousness
    of the problem, the emergency detection network either responded with
    an automatic abort sequence or gave the astronaut crew and NASA
    flight controllers time to assess the situation.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Operation of the IU equipment generated
    considerable amounts of heat which had to be transferred away from
    the components and dissipated into space. This was the function of
    the environmental control system. It consisted of cold plates (as
    mounting surfaces for most of the electronic gear), and integral
    coolant passages for thermal control of (1) the computer, (2) the
    data adapter, (3) the flight control computer, and (4) the ST-124
    platform. Heat was dissipated to a coolant mixture, similar to the
    antifreeze used in a car (60 percent methanol, 40 percent water),
    that was pumped through the 16 cold plates and the integral coolant
    passages. An additional 16 cold plates, located in the upper skirt
    section of the S-IVB, were also connected to the IU's coolant pumping
    system. Warmed coolant was pumped through a sublimator to reduce its
    temperature before it was routed back through the coolant passages
    and cold plates. A comparatively simple device, the sublimator
    consisted of a water supply to a porous plate with ice frozen in the
    pores, because the pores were exposed to the frigid environment of
    space. In the course of passage through the sublimator, heat from the
    coolant was transferred to the plate, the ice was converted to water
    vapor, and the water vapor was dissipated into
    space.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">To ensure trouble-free operation of the
    equipment in the IU, IBM established tightly controlled preparation
    and installation conditions during assembly of the IU. Tubing,
    valves, fittings, components, and subassemblies moved in a steady
    steam through various "clean-room" environments for checks and
    cleansing to establish minimums of contamination. MSFC specifications
    for the clean rooms varied, with increasing stringency ranging from
    class I to class IV rooms; this successively reflected greater
    requirements for clothing worn by personnel, temperature, humidity,
    and particle counts. For most clean-room operations, specifications
    allowed no particles greater than 175 microns in the air; although
    examination and qualification of some critical items established a
    limit of 20 microns-about the diameter of a human hair-and a count of
    no more than 6 per cubic meter. Cleaning for super-critical items
    included laminar flow work benches, de-ionized water, various
    combination of solvents, and ultrasonic systems. Once parts and
    assemblies were cleaned and ready for installation, there was the
    problem of transferring them from the clean-room environment to the
    "dirtier" area of IU assembly. Since the IU was too large to bring
    into the clean rooms, IBM [<A NAME="253"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">253</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] decided to take the
    clean-room environment to the IU instead. The company used a trio of
    mobile clean rooms on casters, which had been hung with heavy vinyl
    curtain walls and equipped with air filters and blowers to maintain
    class IV working conditions.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Installation of equipment within the IU was
    accompanied by a series of checkout operations. Beginning with
    delivery of individual components, IBM personnel checked them against
    equipment specification drawings and subjected them to acceptance
    tests, followed by functional checks as items were mounted in the IU.
    As the various systems of the IU began to shape up, components and
    systems were checked until the IU was complete. Afterward, up to
    eight weeks of exhaustive simulation tests were conducted; these
    simulations included preflight ground checkouts and others for
    liftoff, trajectory, and orbit. When the test and simulation phase
    was complete, the IU was ready for shipment. Critical components,
    such as the ST-124, the computer, and the data adapter were taken out
    and packaged separately, then flown along with the IU to the Cape. At
    the Cape, these components were reassembled and rechecked before the
    IU was stacked into the rest of the vehicle and prepared for complete
    preflight checkout.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Despite the great emphasis on clean room
    facilities and spotless surroundings, IBM on one occasion finished
    production of an IU on the deck of a barge while floating down the
    Tennessee and Mississippi rivers. During 1965, work on the IU fell
    behind as a result of changes in instrumentation. The schedule for
    "stacking" the first Saturn IB (AS-201) for launch early in 1966 was
    apparently going to slip badly unless work on the IU could be
    accelerated. Marshall executives pressured their own IU project
    managers by demanding to know what they were going to do to make the
    launch date. Luther Powell and Sidney Sweat, from the IU project
    office at MSFC, brainstormed the situation and proposed a way to make
    up time. At that point, there was no aircraft large enough to deliver
    the IU by air. Instead, the IU was scheduled to be carried to the
    Cape via a barge down the Tennessee and Mississippi rivers, one of
    the most time-consuming elements in the IU delivery schedule.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Powell and Sweat proposed finishing the IU
    while enroute aboard the barge and submitted their idea to their IBM
    counterparts, who agreed with the unlikely proposal. Because the
    enclosed barge was equipped with internal environmental controls
    anyhow, it was no great problem to set up a workable clean-room
    atmosphere by rigging a series of heavy plastic shrouds for
    additional environmental control inside the barge canopy. Marshall
    and IBM specialists agreed on specific jobs to be done on the barge
    so that no critical areas or hardware would be subject to
    environmental degradation during the trip. With detailed work
    schedules set up, arrangements were made for delivery of key parts
    and supplies at designated ports along the river. In case of
    unanticipated [<A NAME="254"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">254</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] needs, constant
    radio contact with MSFC permitted instantaneous dispatch of a light
    plane with emergency deliveries to any nearby airport; there, a
    government truck could pick them up and deliver them.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The unusual voyage worked. The IU was complete
    by the time it reached New Orleans. The most serious problems proved
    to be the physical condition of the traveling IU working team.
    Despite 16-18 hour workdays, the meals concocted by the barge's chef
    produced a chubbier group of electronics specialists by the end of
    the trip.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#8.39">39</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Barge trips being the exception, an intensive
    effort in quality control extended to the fabricating and
    manufacturing process and encompassed the subcontractors as well. In
    one instance, IBM began having leakage problems with the manifolds
    carrying the coolant of the environmental control system. On IU-204,
    engineers finally decided to restudy the whole process, since IU-204
    was to be on a manned launch of the Saturn IB. Manifolds on other IUs
    in production were also removed, because these too were to be used on
    man-rated vehicles. The subcontractor, the Solar Division of
    International Harvester, had originally dealt with the frustrating
    problems of welding the aluminum alloy. During a thorough review of
    the procedure, Solar found that only minor variances in the use of
    the welding fixtures created the difficulties and thereafter imposed
    even stricter procedures for this crucial
    operation.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#8.40">40</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> In spite of the constant theme of using proven
    hardware and systems, the different requirements of the Saturn
    program called forth some new equipment and attendant "teething"
    problems. Not infrequently, IBM sent delegations to vendors and
    subcontractors to help work out problems in quality control, welding,
    and soldering.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#8.41">41</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> In coping with these situations, IBM also called on
    MSFC technicians for assistance. A particularly dramatic instance
    occurred during the summer of 1967, when MSFC discovered cracks in
    the solder joints of the flight computer for IU-502, and IBM
    simultaneously discovered the same problem on IU-503. The discovery
    was unsettling for two reasons. In the first place, the units had
    already been man-rated and qualified for flight; the soldering
    problem should not have occurred. Second, the same kind of unit was
    already placed in vehicle AS-501, which was at Cape Kennedy being
    readied for the first launch of a Saturn V later in the year. Calling
    from Huntsville to NASA's Apollo Program Office, MSFC's Chief of
    Industrial Operations, Edmund O'Connor, warned Phillips in
    Washington: "Right now there is no impact, but this is potentially
    serious." It was decided to continue the checkout of AS-501 at the
    Cape, while sending a spare computer to the manufacturer, Electronics
    Communications Incorporated, for teardown, inspection, and rework of
    many of the solder joints. In this operation, technicians used a
    technique worked out by MSFC personnel in collaboration with their
    counterparts at the vendor's plant.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    launch, the vehicle really began "thinking on its own" five seconds
    before liftoff when the IU was activated. The vehicle's control
    system first executed a series of time-programmed attitude maneuvers.
    After rising vertically for about 12 seconds, the IU's computer used
    stored roll and pitch commands to activate the gimbaled engines,
    thereby rolling the huge rocket to a proper flight azimuth and, at
    the same time, pitching it to the prescribed angle of attack for the
    first-stage boost. When the IU received a signal that the propellant
    level in the S-IC fuel tank had reached a specified point, it
    initiated commands for first-stage engine cutoff, followed by stage
    separation. Soon after the start of second-stage (S-II) ignition, the
    vehicle was controlled by a concept called "path adaptive guidance,"
    which put the rocket on a trajectory that would use the propellants
    efficiently. About once every two seconds, the computer checked the
    vehicle's current position and flight conditions, comparing it with
    the optimum situation desired at the end of powered flight (altitude,
    velocity, residual propellants, etc.). As required, the IU generated
    correction signals from the computer through the data adapter to the
    analog flight control computer, which then issued appropriate gimbal
    commands to the engines. Engine cutoff and stage separation of the
    S-II from the S-IVB occurred when the IU sensed predetermined
    propellant levels. Because the vehicle had reached its approximate
    orbital altitude by this time, the S-IVB ignition and burn were
    fairly short-just enough time to ensure altitude and speed for a
    secure parking orbit.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">If it became necessary to abort the mission,
    each Saturn carried a propellant dispersion system (PDS). This
    euphemism referred to a destruct mechanism to terminate the flight of
    any stage of the vehicle after the astronaut crew had separated from
    the rocket. The PDS system complied with regulations established by
    the officials of the Air Force Eastern Test Range and was under the
    control of the range safety officer, who could end the flight if the
    vehicle wandered beyond the prescribed limits of the flight path or
    otherwise became a safety hazard. A radio frequency unit received,
    decoded, and controlled the PDS commands, and an ordnance train
    demolished the stage or stages by rupturing the propellant tanks. The
    ordnance train included initiator assemblies and flexible
    linear-shaped charges situated in strategic locations to rip open the
    tanks after engine cutoff, spilling the propellants in a pattern to
    minimize their mixing during the process.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    did not carry it into the stage [<A NAME="256"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">256</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] ahead. The IU
    contained the program for arming and firing the ordnance systems both
    for stage separation and for triggering the retrorockets. The timing
    of the stage separation sequence was keyed to the rated thrust of
    each stage, which began to fall off as the propellants reached
    depletion. The stages were separated when an explosive device around
    the circumference of the vehicle severed a tension strap, thereby
    allowing the appropriate stage separation sequence to take place. As
    the retrorockets quickly pushed the spent stage backward, the next
    live stage continued in a short coasting trajectory to make sure
    adequate distance separated it from its predecessor and to resettle
    the propellants before engine ignition.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> To decelerate spent stages and settle the propellants
    in each of the succeeding live stages, MSFC designers used a variety
    of rocket systems, including small solid-propellant motors and small
    liquid-propellant engines. The various models of the Saturn launch
    vehicle family actually carried more solid-propellant systems than
    liquid-propellant rocket engines: the Saturn I mounted 32
    solid-propellant motors of various types; the Saturn IB mounted 31;
    and the Saturn V carried 22.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Earth-orbital sequence of the S-IVB
    permitted the IU to compute reignition times continuously and take
    updated data from ground stations. With only one main engine for
    direct thrust control, the IU managed S-IVB roll, pitch, and yaw
    through its liquid propellant auxiliary propulsion system (APS).
    After final checks, the IU controlled the vehicle's entry into the
    translunar trajectory. A pair of jettisonable solid retrorockets and
    the APS together provided ullage control, followed by main-stage
    firing of the J-2 and engine cutoff when the IU reported that
    acceptable injection conditions had been achieved. Finally, when the
    spacecraft and lunar module disengaged from the S-IVB and IU, the IU
    and the third stage's APS units provided attitude stabilization for
    the transposition and docking maneuver. About 6.5 hours from liftoff,
    the tasks of the IU were finished.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Development of checkout systems and the
    instrument unit reflected the same patterns as stage development.
    Despite attempts to rely on existing systems and equipment, the size
    and sophistication of the Saturn program required new development.
    New computer languages such as ATOLL were introduced to solve
    problems arising from the peculiarities of design, test, and several
    different contractors, each of whom had been using different computer
    languages. Automation of checkout and of static-firing tests of
    Saturn stages was a notable accomplishment, even if, some test
    engineers were reluctant to surrender control to new, electronic
    masters.</FONT></P>

    unit, using many theories and design features that originated in the
    wartime V-2 program in Germany, is an interesting example of
    technology transfer. Of course, the Saturn program itself generated
    several advanced ideas. The need to reduce weight stimulated new
    research into the use of beryllium and lithium-magnesium alloys;
    reliability and operational requirements stimulated new research in
    microminiature circuitry such as the triple modular
    redundancy.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Obviously, each contractor had a
    responsibility for managing its own respective engine, stage, or
    instrument unit. Overall management and coordination of these various
    elements was NASA's responsibility, a job carried out by the Marshall
    Space Flight Center, which also supervised the delivery of the
    Saturn's various parts to test sites and to Cape Kennedy for
    launch.</FONT></P>
