    critically dependent on the "launch window," when trajectories of the
    orbiting moon and the space vehicle were compatible. Crucial
    slippages in preparation time were avoided during the final weeks
    prior to launch so that liftoff occurred during the "launch window."
    Schedules and deadlines extended back to the production process of
    rockets and their complementary equipment-a process that was
    nationwide and exceedingly complex. Components from thousands of
    contractors and subcontractors not only had to be completed on time,
    but all components had to arrive on schedule at one of the major
    centers so that units could be assembled and thoroughly checked out.
    The units were then shipped to Cape Kennedy for stacking on the
    flight vehicle. The Saturn V required 56 railroad tank cars to supply
    its necessary propellants. The various stages for one launch vehicle
    spent up to 70 days in transit at sea before arriving at Cape
    Kennedy, while the S-IVB and the instrument unit arrived as airborne
    cargoes. In the background were over 20 000 contractors and
    subcontractors who supplied hundreds of thousands of individual parts
    for the Saturn V. In 1966, Arthur Rudolph, speaking as the Director
    of MSFC's Saturn V Program Office, commented succinctly, "Not the
    least of the problems in the Saturn V system is
    logistics."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Wernher von Braun, Rudolph's superior at
    Huntsville, pointed out two special reasons for emphasizing
    logistics. First, the costs of logistics might run to as much as one
    third of the entire launch vehicle program's budget. Any improvement,
    he stressed, saved money fast. Furthermore, von Braun said, logistics
    seemed to be taken for granted too often, and this led to troubles.
    By 1966, the Saturn launch vehicles had been
    [<A NAME="294"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">294</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] launched successfully 13 times, and good logistics
    was an important factor in this record of success. Still, there were
    occasional logistical tangles, and "there have been some awfully
    close calls," von Braun warned. Although the term logistics could be
    applied to many functions such as financial analysis and procurement,
    the word as used during the Saturn program applied to activities in
    direct support of hardware development, testing, and mission
    operations. This task included spares provisioning, inventory
    management, maintenance and maintainability, training and technical
    support documentation, transportation, the supply of propellants and
    pressurants, and the management, coordination, and evaluation of the
    entire process.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In retrospect, the need for a logistical
    program seems logical and obvious, but it was slow to develop; the
    lack of such a program hampered the Saturn program for several years.
    When Congress passed the Space Act in 1958, the U.S. manned space
    program relied primarily on rocket vehicles derived from the nation's
    military ballistic missile programs. Despite their internal
    complexities, the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft were manageable under
    existing conditions, and the Air Force provided the requisite support
    functions for the launch vehicles and related logistical phases. The
    Apollo program changed the ground rules, because NASA intended to
    supply its own launch vehicles, but lack of time and money stalled
    the implementation of a logistical setup for the Saturn launch
    vehicle program.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#10.3">3</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> In the early phases of Saturn program planning, many
    officials felt that there was no need for military-style "launch
    vehicle system logistics" based on rocket weapons because NASA did
    not have the problems of large numbers of rockets and dispersed
    launch sites. Lamentably, this seemed to lead to a second assumption:
    since a weapon logistical system seemed inappropriate for NASA, a
    consensus evolved that there was no need for a logistical program at
    all.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#10.4">4</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> This weakness in reasoning stemmed partially from
    differences in the nature of the launch vehicles. NASA planned to
    launch a limited number of vehicles at fixed intervals and from one
    point, contrasted with a theoretical military situation where many
    launches occurred at unscheduled times from widely scattered launch
    sites or field positions. In a national defense situation, numbers of
    missiles and unanticipated circumstances required an elaborate
    logistical backup. Troops in the field were essentially unschooled as
    engineers and relied on a logistical array of technical manuals,
    parts, spares, and rigidly scheduled maintenance. Saturn personnel,
    on the other hand, included a high percentage of engineers. They did
    not have to rely on military procedures but could refer immediately
    to engineering drawings and work out an appropriate "fix"
    [<A NAME="295"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">295</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] on the spot, supported by conveniently accessible
    laboratories and machine shops at the launch
    site.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#10.5">5</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The hopeful assumptions about the launch
    vehicles did not suffice. Factors that required logistical management
    included the size and complexity of vehicles, the wide geographic
    dispersal of launch and test sites, the pace of the program, the
    armies of technicians involved, and the number of suppliers around
    the country. "Misinterpretation then, caused neglect of an integrated
    logistics program," Rudolph admitted. "Thus we... created for
    ourselves a considerable problem by not allowing enough thought and
    planning toward logistics at the very outset." Theoretically, once
    administrators pinpointed a basic weakness in the Saturn program
    managerial structure, it should have been fairly economical to borrow
    some techniques of weapon logistics and adapt them to NASA's
    requirements. Comprehensive programs existed for the Minuteman and
    Pershing programs, but the logistics for an older, smaller rocket did
    not always prove adequate for a newer, larger one. As Rudolph
    observed, "I am not at all sure that logistic support of a launch
    vehicle program with its high rate of advancement in the state of
    technology and its associated highly complex ground support equipment
    is not more difficult than logistic support of a weapons
    system."</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Further difficulties emerged as NASA
    management moved belatedly to establish an adequate logistical
    program. As problem areas became identified, additional funds to
    resolve the problems simply did not exist. When systems analyses
    indicated badly needed changes in logistics, the program manager had
    to take some sort of corrective action with existing funds. It came
    to making tradeoffs; the program manager began to rob Peter to pay
    Paul and sometimes found himself in a dilemma. As Rudolph phrased it,
    "how much of a calculated risk can he afford to take"? In 1961-1962,
    Saturn V managers from MSFC and personnel from the Apollo Program
    Office at NASA Headquarters initiated a series of "intensive,
    accelerated studies" to bring the logistical picture into focus.
    Essentially, the goal was to update the logistical organization to
    fit the prevailing status of vehicle development and the availability
    of funds. "This agonizing reappraisal lasted over many months,"
    Rudolph recalled, "but in this way, we were able to tailor tightly, I
    repeat, tailor our logistical to meet the essential requirement of
    each stage, yet stay within budget limitations."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#10.6">6</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Unsnarling the logistical tangle within the
    existing budget included the reeducation of the program managers and
    program personnel throughout the organization. Brigadier General
    Edmund F. O'Connor, Director of Industrial Operations at Marshall,
    emphasized the general lack of attention to logistics and
    misunderstandings about it in the early years. He believed that no
    visibility existed. "In other words," O'Connor continued, "we were
    having the same kind of trouble with logistics that we had with
    documentation, reliability, and the like. We had a serious
    [<A NAME="296"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">296</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] communications problem, no logistics baseline, no
    logistics thread running through the entire
    program."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#10.7">7</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The outcome of this reevaluation was a
    formally organized logistical program that would keep logistical
    requirements up to date and that would hopefully avoid future
    problems. As the new plans emerged, NASA managers realized that the
    logistical programs of the contractors were also unclear. No one knew
    if contractor progress had achieved desired goals or if problems
    existed. Under the new regimen, Saturn V contractors began
    formulating logistical progress reports, and all developments were
    plotted against logistical control charts. In addition, each of the
    hardware managers acquired a logistical manager, a move that
    reflected the increasing concern and attention to the problem.
    Rudolph installed an overall logistical manager in his office to keep
    tabs on the lower echelons and the contractors, as well as on the
    MSFC laboratories in Huntsville.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#10.8">8</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA's logistical management finally
    crystallized by 1963. Much of the push to reorganize the logistical
    format came from Stan Smolensky of NASA Headquarters and from
    Eberhard Rees, Deputy Director-Technical, in von Braun's office at
    MSFC. At the top of the logistical organization, NASA set up a
    Logistics Management Office at the staff level in the Office of
    Manned Space Flight (OMSF) in Washington. This new office reported
    directly to the Apollo Program Manager at OMSF and integrated the
    overall Apollo-Saturn support programs. For the Saturn launch
    vehicles themselves, MSFC organized a Project Logistics Office which
    reported to the Director of Industrial Operations. This office
    functioned both at a staff level and in an operational capacity, and
    acted in close cooperation with the respective program managers
    within the Saturn program as well as with the R&amp;D laboratories at
    Marshall. The R&amp;D laboratories had the technical responsibility
    for the development of much of the launch vehicle's systems and
    supporting hardware. For example, the Test Laboratory did
    considerable investigation of the special purpose vehicles, and the
    Astrionics Laboratory designated an individual to cooperate on work
    involving the instrument unit. Because many parts and components were
    being produced by the factories and the vehicles were taking shape,
    the project logistics office had to decide whether to repurchase or
    switch parts if a manufacturer decided to close down a particular
    operation or start up a different product line. This kind of
    situation meant that Marshall's personnel who were involved in the
    quality and reliability aspects also became part of the logistical
    organization. With the Project Logistics Office in operation in
    Huntsville, Houston's MSC relied on MSFC's growing capability for
    moving the command module, service module, and other large bits and
    pieces of spacecraft hardware around the country. As for logistical
    requirements emanating from the launch site in Florida, John C.
    Goodrum, head of [<A NAME="297"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">297</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] MSFC's Project
    Logistics Office, remarked that "Kennedy always considered themselves
    a logistics-oriented center," with internal administrative channels
    to handle the job, although Marshall occasionally provided
    transportation for KSC.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The cooperative aspects of the logistical
    program included the Department of Defense, which supplied some of
    the propellants and pressurants for the Saturn program. Some
    cryogenic production plants were jointly operated under the auspices
    of the Department of Defense and NASA, and MSFC monitored the
    specifications and construction of other plants around the country.
    By 1965, the major plants were in operation to supply cryogenics for
    the rising tempo of Saturn testing and launch operations. This
    capability was especially important for liquid hydrogen
    (LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">). The space program helped raise the production levels
    to 190 metric tons per day, with the Saturn program absorbing up to
    95 percent of the nation's total capacity. Once a plant became
    operative, NASA and MSFC were eager to coordinate its production with
    an active test and flight series, because increased
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    consumption was a way to save money. Producers established a price
    for their product that was in direct relation to the volume sold. In
    the early 1960s, liquid hydrogen was about $20.00 per kilogram, but
    the price dropped to around $2.20 per kilogram for 450 kilograms, 45
    to 65 cents per kilogram for 2250 kilograms, and leveled off at
    around 35 cents per kilogram for higher volumes. Fortunately, MSFC
    "never got pinned" to the $20.00 curve, Goodrum remarked, but the
    space agency paid some fairly high prices for liquid hydrogen from
    time to time. For transportation of assorted cryogenics, MSFC relied
    on fleets of trucks, mostly from commercial carriers; the Air Force
    lent occasional support.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By 1966, Rudolph felt that the logistical
    problem had been controlled, and he confidently announced that the
    first Saturn V launch, early in 1967, would get off on schedule early
    in the coming year. The success in coping with the logistics of the
    launch cannot be underestimated. A comparison of PERT figures
    indicated a total of 40 000 events for the contractors working on the
    three stages and the instrument unit. For the ground support
    equipment (GSE) managers, over 60 000 events needed to be tracked.
    The components for ground support were manufactured throughout the
    United States and arrived at test sites and KSC by every conceivable
    means of modern transportation. Rudolph remarked that it was
    virtually impossible to illustrate graphically the full GSE
    logistical program and harder still to describe
    it.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The GSE delivery requirements had many
    parallels in the transport logistical requirements for the various
    rocket stages of the Saturn program. The development of this phase of
    Saturn logistics also involved a transportation network from coast to
    coast and relied on a wide spectrum of transport equipment.</FONT>

    vehicles were originally designed for the utmost in vehicle integrity
    and manned missions, it would be inadvisable to degrade the integrity
    of Saturn components by using inferior transport modes and
    techniques. Rocket stages were transported thousands of miles and
    experienced hundreds of hours of constant vibration. There was always
    the possibility of damage to welded joints and seals, as well as to
    delicate components that were manufactured to very high tolerances.
    On arrival at Cape Kennedy, additional checkout tests frequently
    exposed a problem that could be traced to the transportation
    sequence. The logistics of rocket stages were not to be taken
    lightly.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As early as 1959, personnel at ABMA began to
    study the problems of transporting boosters from the manufacturing
    area to the test stands and the problem of the long journey from
    Huntsville to the Atlantic Missile Test Range in Florida. Early
    proposals considered using existing transporters devised for Redstone
    and Jupiter missiles, but this equipment proved to be too small. To
    carry the larger Saturn series on Redstone-Jupiter transporters,
    investigators discovered they would have to disassemble and remove
    engines and associated equipment, then replace the engines each time
    the complete vehicle moved from manufacturing to testing areas. This
    process was repeated during shipment to the launch site. Engineers
    warned that such frequent reassembling would compromise the
    reliability of the vehicle.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As a second proposal, planners envisioned a
    gargantuan BARC-style amphibious vessel. The acronym came from Army
    nomenclature for an amphibious machine in military inventory at the
    time: Barge, Amphibious, Resupply, Cargo. The Army used BARCs for
    over-the-shore delivery of heavy tanks and other cargo, and this
    apparently served as the inspiration for an enormous BARC to
    transport Saturn rockets. This unit would pick up a Saturn vehicle at
    the manufacturing area, carry the vehicle to the test site and reload
    it after tests, and then the BARC would lumber overland and plunge
    into the Tennessee River. After cruising down the Tennessee and the
    Mississippi rivers, the ponderous BARC would churn through the Gulf
    of Mexico, clamber onto the Florida coast at Cape Kennedy, and move
    directly to the launching pads. The BARC concept was eventually
    scrapped. The shallow draft raised doubts about its seaworthiness in
    the Gulf, and its dimensions and difficult maneuverability would
    necessitate major modifications to existing buildings and
    manufacturing areas to accommodate the transporter alone. The
    engineers concluded that it would cost $5 000 000 and would not be
    operational for four years. The ABMA study recommended the
    construction of towable transporters for the Saturn vehicles and
    planned to use proven, seaworthy vessels on the waterborne leg of
    operations.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="299"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">299</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] In October 1959,
    the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) gave the go-ahead to the
    Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) to begin engineering studies on
    the Tennessee River for dock facilities that would be conveniently
    accessible to the manufacturing complex at Redstone Arsenal. By
    December, AOMC received further authorization from ARPA not only to
    construct the docks but also to begin designs for a barge to carry
    the oversize boosters to the launch site at Cape Canaveral. The
    engineers decided to equip the dock areas with electrical winches for
    a roll-on/roll-off operation that would use the ground transporter to
    wheel the stage aboard the barge, ride with it to its destination,
    and wheel it out again. This operation promised the least strain and
    damage to the stage during the strenuous handling and transportation
    phases.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The size of the Saturn I first-stage boosters
    promised some headaches when the time came to move completed stages
    around the manufacturing areas and between the ships and the
    static-firing areas of Redstone Arsenal. The Saturn engineers in
    Huntsville devised a solution to the problem. For the final assembly
    of the Saturn I first stage, workers used a pair of huge circular
    assembly jigs to position the cluster of one center tank and eight
    smaller tanks around it. These assembly fixtures at either end of the
    rocket then became the load-bearing structures for transportation.
    After the completed booster was raised with huge jacks, wheel and
    axle assemblies were positioned at each end. With the stage lowered
    onto these assemblies, they were affixed to the assembly jigs, which
    now became support cradles for towing the stage. The wheel
    assemblies, using aircraft tires, were designed for independent
    braking and hydraulic steering. The transporter was towed by an army
    truck tractor at five to eight kilometers per hour through successive
    phases of checkout and test. NASA also used the transporter for
    loading and unloading the stage from the barges that carried it from
    Huntsville to the launch site on Florida's east
    coast.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V,
    MSFC's Test Laboratory designed a similar transporter in 1963. The
    S-IC transporter used a modular wheel concept, based on a two-wheel,
    steerable unit and clustered to comprise two dollies fore and aft-a
    total of 24 wheels. The wheels, similar to the 24-ply tires for
    earth-moving equipment, stood about as high as a man. Each modular
    pair of wheels incorporated a separate system for power steering,
    with all systems of a particular dolly interconnected by a computer
    to correlate the steering angles for all wheels in unison. Since the
    dolly units could be steered to &#177;90ū from the axis of the
    transporter, the entire rig and its load could be maneuvered
    sideways, into, and out of checkout bays and test areas. MSFC used a
    modified Army M-26 tank retriever as the tractor unit for towing the
    S-IC and its huge transporter. The M-26, a 179-kilowatt
    (240&endash;horsepower) model weighing 55 metric tons, included 27
    metric tons of water ballast [<A NAME="300"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">300</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] to cope with the
    counterweight of the transporter. The total length of the tractor and
    transporter unit came to about two-thirds the length of a football
    field and was capable of rolling along at eight kilometers per hour.
    In theory, the driver in the tank retriever's cab was in charge of
    the direction of travel, but in practice, he acted as a coordinator
    of a crew of other drivers and transporter personnel. When the S-IC
    transporter rig "hit the road," its entourage included a cluster of
    observers who walked along at each corner of the vehicle and alerted
    the driver coordinator positioned in the front of obstacles and
    clearances that were blocked from his view. The driver in turn
    relayed instructions to drivers on the transporter who were riding in
    cabs front and rear and who could manipulate the massive fore and aft
    dollies as required. Before taking on an actual stage, the entire
    crew trained throughout the MSFC complex on a tubular S-IC simulator
    that was built to the dimensions and weight of the actual
    stage.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    prodigious bulk, could be transported with comparative ease via
    seagoing barges that used the extensive river and canal systems
    constructed around the Michoud and MTF facilities. After testing,
    barges once more carried the S-IC and S-II stages (and earlier S-I
    and S-IB vehicles) to Cape Kennedy. Logistical patterns for the S-IV
    and S-IVB were more complex. S-IVB was smaller than its companions
    and presented some unique handling difficulties in moving it through
    an especially congested area of Los Angeles to the shipping
    facilities. Difficulties were also encountered in loading the stages
    for a barge trip and delivering the stages further north and even
    further inland to the Douglas test facilities at Sacramento.</FONT>

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Customized apparatus for handling and
    transportation of the S-IV and IVB stages was paralleled by
    "customizing" the eventual routes to test and reshipment facilities.
    Although logic compelled logistics engineers to opt for canals and
    seaborne transportation instead of land transport, the overland mode
    still had to be used. The overland mode was the only way to move a
    stage from the manufacturing areas to the loading docks for the canal
    and seaborne segments of its journey. Douglas and NASA personnel in
    California began negotiations to move a 27 000-kilogram load on
    roads, subject to the various jurisdictions of state, county, and
    city. The planning and coordination took days. Fortunately,
    cooperation of local law enforcement organizations expedited the
    task, and flagmen from railroads in the area agreed to special duty
    when the stage and its accompanying entourage approached railroad
    crossings. Commercial firms that operated vans and various truck
    equipment, as well as local school districts with extensive bus
    schedules were called into consultation on the logistics of overland
    rockets. Because the rocket stage spread across all available lane
    space and the shoulders of the road, no parking space remained.
    Vehicles waited at roadside until the stage transporter moved by.
    Regular auto traffic could be rerouted, but bus lines and cartage
    business on normal schedules had to reroute their trips more
    carefully. The stage and transporter spread up as well as out, so
    utility companies agreed to raise (or even bury) their lines when no
    practical alternative routes seemed feasible. All other encumbrances
    along the right of way were eliminated
    [<A NAME="302"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">302</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] along the final route. Finally, Douglas had the
    responsibility to coordinate the remaining myriad travel
    arrangements. NASA representatives cooperated with various military
    personnel on sea transport, while all three elements (Douglas, NASA,
    and the military) kept in touch on times of arrival and departure,
    interior schedules, proper support equipment to load and unload the
    cargo, and additional problems.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Inevitably, complications arose. Early in the
    S-IV program, a stage enroute from Huntington Beach to Santa Monica
    for transfer to a barge collided with one of nature's denizens. H. E.
    Bauer, then a senior S-IV manager with Douglas, easily recalled the
    novel circumstances. It happened early in the morning, with the
    loaded transporter creeping at 6.4 kilometers per hour. "At that
    speed nothing much should happen," Bauer reminisced, "but, incredible
    as it may sound, we did run over a very mature and ripe skunk." By a
    stroke of luck, the stage itself escaped unscathed, but the
    transporter remained a large, odoriferous problem-"we had a 23 1/2
    ft. wide, 46 1/2 ft. long, 22 000 lb. skunk on our hands." With other
    missions pending for the one-of-a-kind transporter, the Douglas
    Aircraft Company chemists who devised an effective deodorizer ranked
    high on the list of unsung heroes of the Saturn
    program.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    stage, manufactured at Seal Beach, proved to be less difficult. The
    Seal Beach complex was only a few kilometers from the Navy's harbor
    at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station, and a broad, four-lane
    highway facilitated movement of the S-II from the manufacturing area
    to the docks, although all local traffic had to be stopped during the

    installed inside and out. The S-II access equipment resembled that of
    the S-IV and S-IVB, a work platform which moved up and down an
    internal tunnel inserted through the center of both the oxidizer and
    fuel tanks. Movement, shipment, and accessories for the Saturn's
    engines relied on more conventional means. Early in the 1960s, after
    preliminary static tests at Edwards Air Force Base in California, F-1
    engines were flown to Huntsville by the U.S. Air Force Military Air
    Transport Service aboard C-133B cargo planes. Beginning in 1967, the

    directly from port to port-from the Tennessee docks, down the
    Mississippi, across the Gulf, and up the Atlantic Coast to the launch
    site at Cape Canaveral. After leaving the Mississippi, the barge and
    tug followed the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway to St. George Sound,
    located off the Florida panhandle; across the Gulf of Mexico to San
    Carlos Bay (near Ft. Myers); through the Okeechobee Waterway across
    Florida to Stuart, on the Atlantic Coast; then up the Florida
    Intracoastal Waterway to the Cape Canaveral Barge Canal. The complete
    voyage from Huntsville covered about 3500 kilometers and took 10
    days; by using the Intracoastal Waterway, the barge and its cargo
    traveled only 452 kilometers in open seas, and the route kept them no
    more than 80 kilometers from sheltered ports along the Gulf Coast.
    The barge and tug entourage usually included a 12-man complement: a
    five-man crew from Mechling to handle the barge and tug, a half-dozen
    NASA personnel traveling with the stage, and one government monitor

    April 1961 when it departed from Huntsville for Cape Canaveral. Its
    cargo included a dummy S-IV stage for the SA-1 vehicle and a huge
    water-ballasted tank that simulated the size and weight of the Saturn
    S-1 first-stage booster. Crews at MSFC and the Cape rehearsed
    movements for loading, unloading, maneuvering the stage and its
    transporter, operating the barge. The Palaemon made the return trip
    in May, in time for its first operational cruise, carrying a dummy
    S-IV payload along with the first SA-1 flight stage that had just
    completed static-firing tests and final checkout at Huntsville. But
    on 2 June 1961, the single lock at Wheeler Dam on the Tennessee River
    collapsed. All river traffic halted and the Palaemon and its intended
    cargo were trapped upstream. The launch schedules were endangered,
    and NASA and MSFC scrambled to find a way to get the stage to
    Florida. The high national priority rating of the Saturn program and
    the cargo operations of the Atomic Energy Commission at Oak Ridge,
    Tennessee spurred prompt action. It did not take long for the

    Navy, and requested another suitable YFNB barge. The Navy found one
    in the "mothball fleet" at Pensacola and MSFC personnel went to work
    on its modifications. It was appropriately christened Compromise. The
    cargo aboard the Palaemon finally left the MSFC docks on 5 August
    1961; workers unloaded the cargo at Wheeler Dam and towed the Saturn
    SA-1 booster and S-IV dummy stage around the locks, reloaded the
    booster and dummy stage aboard the Compromise, and reached the Cape
    on 15 August, meeting the 10-day delivery schedule. NASA pressed a
    different tug into service, using a tow line, and the Compromise
    carried its load exposed; the tight schedule did not allow time to
    fit the barge with the distinctive metal canopy or controls of the
    Palaemon. Before the end of the year, Compromise was rebuilt to more
    suitable specifications, complete with protective canopy and a newly
    outfitted pilot house in front. Prior to the reopening of the Wheeler
    lock in the spring of 1962, NASA authorities decided that the
    original sobriquet for the Compromise did not convey the proper
    image. The barge was recommissioned the Promise.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    relied on ocean freighters. The larger S-II stage needed more
    specialized treatment, since its size did not allow it to be stored
    within the confines of a freighter's hold or above deck. In December
    1963, NASA concluded agreements with the Military Sea Transport
    Service to use the Point Barrow for shipment of S-II stages from
    California to test and launch sites in Mississippi and Florida. The
    Point Barrow was a Navy LSD (Landing Ship, Dock) that had seen
    extensive Arctic duty before its conversion for the space program.

    one of the stages had to be carried back and forth between Michoud
    and Huntsville for additional tests and analysis at MSFC, and these
    components could be lashed down as a deck load on one of the regular
    commercial barges that plied the rivers. Components for the S-IC

    apiece. The average voyage of 1996 kilometers from New Orleans docks
    to the MSFC docks in Huntsville involved several segments and
    changeovers as the barge string was passed from one towboat to
    another. The first segment ran 1396 kilometers upriver to Cairo,
    Illinois, and took 10 days. At Cairo, the "rocket barge" joined a

    channel was quite comfortable for river barge operations. For the

    35 kilometers from Paducah. Then followed a placid, 322-kilometer
    cruise at about 14 kilometers per hour as the river turned south
    across the western end of Tennessee, past a series of small river
    landings with whimsical names like Sarah's Garter and Petticoat

    service to meet logistical needs for the Apollo-Saturn program. In
    support of vehicle dynamic tests at Huntsville, an Army CH-47A,
    dangling its cargo underneath flew from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to
    Huntsville. The Saturn IB load consisted of an adapter unit that
    connected the instrument unit to the service module and housed the
    lunar module. The tapered adapter component, 9 meters long and 6.7
    meters in diameter at the base, made quite an impression as it swayed
    through the air during the 965-kilometer flight from North American's
    facility at Tulsa.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the Saturn I program progressed, NASA
    officials became increasingly concerned about coordinating arrival of
    separate stages at the Cape to meet the launch schedules. Lower
    stages for the Saturn I and Saturn IB required a comparatively short
    voyage from Huntsville and from Michoud. Delivery of the S-IV and
    S-IVB from California also involved the use of seagoing barges and
    transports to carry these upper stages down the Pacific Coast,
    through the Panama Canal, across the Gulf of Mexico, and finally
    across Florida to Cape Canaveral. The odyssey of the S-IV and IVB
    stages required occasional side trips up the Mississippi and
    Tennessee rivers to Huntsville for additional tests at MSFC
    facilities before returning to the Cape. This complex and slow
    operation and the [<A NAME="309"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">309</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] potential delays
    from foul weather at sea generated increasing concern about meeting
    carefully coordinated deliveries of vehicle stages and related
    hardware. Transportation of the larger S-II second stage of the
    Saturn V and the S-IVB third stage from California to the Cape
    multiplied the concern. Another potential weak link was the Panama
    Canal. If the canal were to be shut down for some reason, seaborne
    shipments would be forced around South America and the carefully
    calculated launch schedules would collapse.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Against this background, managers within NASA
    began thinking about other modes of transportation to ensure rapid
    delivery of upper Saturn stages, beginning with the S-IV. The size of
    the S-IV ruled out delivery to the Cape by rail or road. As the lead
    center of launch vehicle development, MSFC let a contract in 1960 to
    the Douglas Aircraft Corporation to determine the feasibility of air
    transport. A Douglas assessment team spent several months on the
    project and came up with a proposal that envisioned a "piggyback"
    concept that used an Air Force C-133 transport. Design studies
    included pictures of the rocket stage positioned above the C-133 and
    perched atop streamlined fairings. Because the stage was exposed to
    the passing airstream, planners expected to fit the stage with a
    streamlined nose cone, with vertical stabilizers at the rear to
    enhance its aerodynamic qualities in transit. Suggestions from other
    sources ran the gamut from airplanes to gliders to lighter-than-air
    vehicles. One proposal envisioned the use of a blimp, which would
    putter along from California to Florida with a swaying S-IV stage
    slung underneath. As late as 1963 serious thought was given to
    resurrecting a modern successor to the prewar dirigible, with an
    interior cargo hold to carry rocket stages.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    own reservoir of experience in the transportation of rockets by
    aircraft. The Douglas Thor IRBM had been freighted regularly on
    transcontinental and intercontinental flights by Douglas C-124
    Globemasters, and the company was confident that this mode of
    transport was practical because its own aerial operations had not
    damaged any rocket or its systems. The Thor, however, had been
    designed for airborne shipment,</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    an existing aircraft to completely enclose the rocket stage with an
    airplane's fuselage.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The idea of a bloated cargo airplane
    originated with an imaginative group associated with John M. Conroy,
    aerial entrepreneur of an outfit aptly named Aero Spacelines,
    Incorporated, in Van Nuys, California. Aero Spacelines intended to
    acquire surplus Boeing B-377 Stratocruisers. About 1960, Conroy and
    some partners acquired title to over a dozen four-engined airliners,
    used mainly by Pan Am and Northwest Orient on their intercontinental
    routes during the Stratocruiser's heyday in the 1950s. The Conroy
    group at first planned to use the planes for
    [<A NAME="310"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">310</FONT></B><FONT

    Air Force rockets also looked promising. By 1961, plans had

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Drawing heavily on his own financial
    resources, Conroy pushed the idea of his bulbous, "volumetric"
    airplane despite the considered opinion of many aircraft engineers
    and aerodynamicists that no plane could be distorted and distended
    enough to swallow an S-IV rocket stage and still be able to fly. But
    Conroy was persuasive. R. W. Prentice, who managed the S-IV logistics
    program at Douglas, remembered him as real "swashbuckler," the sort
    of aviation character that reminded him of the cartoon hero named
    "Smilin'Jack." Conroy apparently found some kindred souls among
    influential Douglas executives, because he persuaded the company to
    go along with him on a presentation to NASA and MSFC. Some of the
    NASA managers were unconvinced, but the energetic Conroy touched a
    responsive chord in MSFC's visionary director, Dr. Wernher von Braun.
    As John Goodrum, chief of MSFC's logistics office, recalled the
    sequence of events, von Braun warmed to the idea from the start. The
    idea was innovative and its boldness appealed to him. Neither MSFC
    nor NASA Headquarters could allocate substantial funds to such a
    project at the time. Nevertheless, buoyed by the interest evinced at
    both Douglas and MSFC, Conroy decided to plunge ahead, although there
    was no guarantee of a contract.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The first phase of the project called for
    lengthening the fuselage (by inserting the cabin section of another
    Stratocruiser) to accommodate the S-IV stage. After the flight test
    of that modification, phase two called for the enlargement of the
    plane's cabin section to approximately double its normal volume. The
    swollen, humpbacked addition to the original Boeing airframe was
    originally fabricated as a nonstructural element stuck on the top of
    the fuselage. This alteration allowed test pilots and engineers to
    conduct flight tests and analyze the altered flying characteristics
    in comparative safety. The first flight occurred on 19 September
    1962, followed by more than 50 hours of cross-country trials and
    other experimental flights. Satisfied that the reconfigured aircraft
    could indeed fly, workmen finally cut away the original inner
    fuselage and the massive external shell was mated to the basic
    airframe as a load-bearing structure. The name Aero Spacelines
    selected for its unique plane was a natural. The former Stratocruiser
    became a B-377 PG: the Pregnant Guppy. The new plane had cost over $1
    000 000.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Guppy's designers intended to make the
    plane a self-contained cargo transportation system. The fuselage
    separated just aft of the wing's trailing edge to load and unload the
    S-IV and other cargoes. The ground crew unloaded and attached three
    portable dollies to the rear part of the plane and disengaged the
    various lines, cables, and bolts connecting the fuselage sections.
    The rear portion was then rolled back to expose the plane's cavernous

    work on the Guppy, Conroy began running out of cash and credit. He
    figured he needed some tangible support from NASA in the form of an
    endorsement to keep his creditors at arm's length. On 20 September
    1962, only one day after the first air trials of the reconfigured
    prototype cargo version, Conroy and an adventuresome flight crew took
    off for a demonstration tour. At this stage of the plane's
    development, the B-377's original fuselage was still intact, and the
    massive hump attached to the outside was held up by an interior
    framework of metal stringers and wooden two-by-fours. Conroy had to
    get a special clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration
    which allowed him to proceed eastward from Van Nuys, as long as he
    avoided major population areas en route. Following several interim
    stops, the Pregnant Guppy flew to Huntsville, where Conroy wanted to
    demonstrate the plane to MSFC officials and perhaps get some form of
    unofficial encouragement to enable him to continue the plane's
    development.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He landed at the airstrip of the Army's
    Redstone Arsenal, a facility shared jointly by MSFC and the Army. The
    Guppy was visited by a mixed group of scoffers and enthusiasts,
    including von Braun. While some onlookers made sour jokes about the
    reputed ability of the awkward-looking plane to fly Saturn rocket
    stages from the Pacific to the Atlantic coast, von Braun was
    delighted. With both time and money in short supply, Conroy wanted to
    pull off a convincing test of the Guppy's ability to fly a heavy
    load. Because there was no time to install enough sandbags in the
    hold to simulate the proposed cargo capacity, the plane was
    completely gassed up with a load of aviation fuel to make up the
    weight difference. MSFC's logistics chief, John Goodrum, observed the
    proceedings, and most of the people around him seemed very doubtful
    of the plane's potential. "In fact," remembered Goodrum, "there were
    some pretty high ranking people who stood right there and shook their
    heads and said it just wouldn't fly-there is no way!"</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With Conroy at the controls, the big plane
    lumbered down the runway and into the air. The pair of MSFC observers
    aboard this first flight included Julian Hamilton, a key manager in
    Saturn logistics programs, and Herman Kroeger, a member of the von
    Braun group since the V-2 program in Germany and a former test pilot.
    Even with the number one and two engines out, the plane could
    maintain course and altitude with only light control. This feat so
    impressed ex-test pilot Kroeger that he lapsed into German in
    describing it to his colleagues after the plane landed. Von Braun was
    so interested that he wanted to fly in the airplane. The MSFC
    director crawled in the airplane and took off, to the consternation
    of those still dubious about the airworthiness of the fuel-heavy
    airplane braced on the inside by a wooden framework. The flight was
    uneventful, and informal contract talks began the same day. There was
    little doubt that Conroy needed some firm support. His
    [<A NAME="312"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">312</FONT></B><FONT

    Huntsville only by borrowing some aviation gas from a friend in

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Conroy was able to supply information for more
    serious contract negotiations by late fall of 1962. Conroy reported
    in a letter to von Braun that performance of the Pregnant Guppy
    guaranteed cruising speed in excess of 378 kilometers per hour. The
    correspondence also revealed the growing extent of MSFC cooperation
    and support for the proposed Guppy operations involving cooperation
    from military bases, although no official contracts had been signed.
    Aero Spacelines planned to keep critical spares at strategic
    locations along its route structure to reduce downtime in case of
    malfunctions. This arrangement included the special allocation of a
    "quick-engine-change" unit at Patrick AFB, Florida, near the
    launching sites of Cape Canaveral. NASA also planned to arrange for
    Aero Spacelines to purchase supplies of fuel and oil at the military

    planning the first two-stage launch of the Saturn I vehicle,
    designated SA-5. The first four launches had carried inert second
    stages, and SA-5 had special significance as the first of the giant
    Saturn boosters to have both stages "live" and operational. The
    agency was growing anxious over the delivery of the S-IV-5 stage
    because of a time slippage caused by test problems, and the Pregnant
    Guppy would save considerable time by flying the stage from
    California to the Cape in 18 hours, as opposed to 18-21 days via
    ship. In a letter dated 25 April 1963, NASA's Director of Manned
    Space Flight, D. Brainerd Holmes, emphasized the Guppy's importance
    to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans. Holmes wanted to make sure
    that the FAA was "advised of NASA's vital interest" in securing the
    Pregnant Guppy's prompt certification so that lost time could be made
    up in the delivery of the S-IV-5 stage. Holmes pointed out that NASA
    had also made several telephone calls to FAA
    officials.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    Guppy operations, Aero Spacelines was finally awarded a contract from
    MSFC, to cover the period from 28 May-31 July 1963, to complete the
    plane's tests and make an evaluation as soon as possible. The FAA
    awarded the B-377 PG an airworthiness certificate on 10 July, and
    MSFC immediately conducted a transcontinental trial flight with a
    simulated S-IV stage aboard. Although the Pregnant Guppy did not
    receive its final certification as a transport craft until 13
    November 1963, NASA relied on the plane to carry Apollo spacecraft
    hardware to Houston during the late summer months, and in
    mid-September the Pregnant Guppy took on the S-IV-5 stage at
    Sacramento for delivery to Cape Kennedy for the launch of SA-5.
    Technical problems in the first stage delayed the launch for many
    weeks, but the two-stage rocket finally made a successful flight on

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For these reasons, as well as NASA's concern
    for the larger space hardware in the Saturn IB and V programs, NASA
    managers expressed interest in correspondingly larger aircraft.
    Because the S-IVB stage was larger than the S-IV, it would require a
    larger plane if air operations were to be continued. A larger plane
    could carry the instrument unit for both the Saturn IB and the Saturn
    V as well as the Apollo lunar module adapter unit. Moreover, a second
    plane could serve as a backup for the original Guppy. At one point in
    the discussions about a second-generation aircraft, serious
    consideration was given to the conversion of an air transport large
    enough to handle the S-II second stage of the Saturn V.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even before the Pregnant Guppy had won its
    first NASA contract, Conroy was writing to von Braun about a
    successor aircraft equipped with powerful turboprop engines and large
    enough to transport the S-IVB. NASA did not seriously consider the
    second-generation Guppy until the original Pregnant Guppy had
    demonstrated its worth. Robert Freitag, NASA Headquarters' Director,
    Manned Space Flight Center Development, wrote von Braun in early 1964
    noting the "outstanding success we have enjoyed with the Pregnant
    Guppy." In addition to the Pregnant Guppy's use by MSFC to carry
    rocket stages, Freitag said the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston
    was anxious about having a backup aircraft available. Freitag
    envisioned three possibilities: acquire a similar Pregnant Guppy and
    rely on water transport for the S-IVB and S-II stages, acquire a
    larger type for S-IVB operations and leave the S-II to water
    transport, and acquire an S-II-size aircraft that could also handle
    the smaller S-IVB. Any of the three possibilities could meet the
    logistical requirements of the Houston center, but a decision was
    needed soon; the timing for production and delivery of Saturn rocket
    stages to the Cape to meet launch schedules was in question. "Since
    time is of the essence, Freitag concluded, "I would appreciate
    receiving your recommendations including advantages and technical
    funding plan for accomplishing our objectives at the earliest

    thought to a mammoth aircraft capable of handling a rocket stage the
    size of the S-II. On 2 February 1964, MSFC drafted a request for
    quotation titled "Large Booster Carrier Aircraft." The document
    suggested the development of either an airplane or a lighter-than-air
    vehicle capable of transporting the
    [<A NAME="314"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">314</FONT></B><FONT

    and the Cape. "In any case, the program is to be characterized by

    or English-built Saunders-Roe Princess flying
    boats.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    that an S-II cargo aircraft would take too long to develop and would
    cost too much. Also the number of planned Saturn V launches was
    revised downward, reducing the requirements for S-II transportation.
    The S-IVB, however, was programmed for frequent launches in both the
    Saturn IB and Saturn V class of vehicles, so the desire for a backup

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As before, Aero Spacelines developed the new
    aircraft with its own resources, although personnel from MSFC came to
    California to cooperate on the design studies, and a flight-test
    expert from NASA's Flight Research Center at Edwards, California,
    worked very closely with the design team. Originally dubbed the B-377
    (VPG) for "Very Pregnant Guppy," the second-generation plane finally
    emerged as the "Super Guppy," or B-377 SG. The larger, heavier
    cargoes for the Super Guppy required increased horsepower. Although
    parts of three other B-377 aircraft were incorporated into the Super
    Guppy, the cockpit, forward fuselage and wing sections, and the
    engines came from a Boeing C-97J, an Air Force transport version of
    the commercial Stratocruiser. This aircraft had Pratt &amp; Whitney
    turboprop engines. Conroy realized that it was imperative for his big
    new airplane to have the more efficient and powerful turboprop
    powerplants. Conroy had learned from his contacts in the Air Force
    that the C-97J airplanes were headed for retirement, and he had hoped
    to get the airframes as salvage and the engines on a low-priced
    lease. Conroy succeeded, with NASA lending special assistance in
    securing the engines. During the spring of 1965, NASA's Office of the
    Administrator made overtures to the Air Force: "We definitely feel
    that it would be in the public interest and advantageous to the
    government if these engines were made available" to transport rocket
    stages, engines, and other large cargoes. "Under these

    although final FAA certification came later in the spring. John C.
    Goodrum, chief of MSFC's Project Logistics Office, felt that the
    utility of the Super Guppy was of such importance that it should be
    considered operational for "critical cargoes" on a "limited basis" as
    soon as possible. Although FAA examiners had not yet flown the Super
    Guppy by March, Goodrum urged operational
    [<A NAME="315"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">315</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] service based on the judgment of NASA's own test
    pilots at Edwards that the plane was satisfactory for transport
    duties. He advised NASA Headquarters that MSFC planned "immediate
    utilization" of the airplane to ship a Saturn instrument unit
    manufactured by IBM in Huntsville. The Super Guppy landed at
    Huntsville within a week, apparently by special arrangement with the
    FAA, and flew the IU to the Douglas plant at Huntington Beach for
    systems testing with an S-IVB stage. The plane made a return trip
    before the end of the month and delivered another S-IVB test stage to
    MSFC.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the Super Guppy became fully operational
    during 1966, its success reflected the expertise accumulated in
    missions using its predecessor. The Super Guppy's cargo was loaded
    from the front, and the entire forward section of the fuselage was
    built to swing aside on hinges just ahead of the wing's leading edge.
    This modification added to the ease and swiftness of its operations,
    and was largely dependent on the ground support techniques and
    equipment developed for the Pregnant Guppy in the early 1960s. After
    modification, equipment designed for the S-IV served equally well for
    the larger S-IVB. The cargo lift trailer (CLT) became a major item in
    the support equipment developed for handling space hardware as air
    cargo. The CLT was developed at MSFC and operated on the scissor-lift
    principle to raise its load for transfer into the cargo hold of the
    airplane. The CLT could also be used as a transporter over short
    distances. A movable pallet supported the S-IV on the CLT. The pallet
    had cradle supports fore and aft that were linked to the pallet with
    shock mounts of an oil-spring type. The CLT raised the pallet to the
    loading level of the cargo bay, then the pallet was rolled off and
    secured inside the aircraft. For aerial shipment, ground crews did
    not use the shroud that protected the rocket stage during water
    transport. Instead, engineers designed lightweight covers to fit over
    the exposed areas fore and aft, and a bank of static desiccators in
    the propellant tanks comprised the environmental control system while
    airborne. Both Guppy aircraft carried the instrumentation to monitor
    pressure, humidity, temperature, and vibration readings in flight as
    part of the plane's permanent equipment. In a typical delivery
    sequence, the rocket stage moved eight kilometers overland from the
    Douglas plant at Huntington Beach to the Los Alamitos Naval Air
    Station. After loading the stage, the pilots flew north to Mather Air
    Base, not far from SACTO. When stage tests were completed, the final
    leg of the airborne logistics sequence concluded with delivery at
    Cape Kennedy for preflight checkout and launch.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    selected SAC bases and other Air Force fields for fuel and
    operational support, and these installations were normally alerted
    ahead of time for the appearance of the strange-looking Guppy in the
    landing pattern. Not long after the start of Pregnant Guppy flights,
    a misadventure occurred, and NASA's S-IV rocket stage was temporarily
    impounded by Air Force security personnel. Don Stewart, who
    represented MSFC as a monitor for the early operational flights,
    recalled that the Guppy pilot had been forced off his normal route
    out of Los Angeles to avoid bad weather, and the plane had begun to
    run low on gas. Both Stewart and the pilot thought their alternate
    field, a SAC base, had been notified of Guppy operations. They were
    mistaken. After a night landing, the plane was surrounded by SAC
    security police brandishing carbines and M-1 rifles. The SAC
    guardsmen were caught off balance by the large and unusual aircraft
    that carried a rocket, and they directed the plane to a remote corner
    of the airfield until the intruder's credentials could be verified.
    The Guppy crew dozed fitfully in the plane until the base commander
    was convinced of Stewart's story, checked with the proper
    authorities, and finally issued a clearance to refuel and take off in
    the early hours of the morning.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In flight, the Pregnant Guppy behaved
    normally, although Air Force and NASA ground crews had to learn to
    cope with some of its unusual idiosyncracies on the ground. During a
    stop at Ellington Air Force Base at Houston, high winds swept into
    the vast hold of the detached aft section, and caused light damage to
    the plane's tail. After a couple of mishaps involving the Super
    Guppy, designers beefed up the massive dome and redesigned the
    latching mechanisms on the hinged nose section. The Super Guppy
    experienced occasional engine problems, and NASA wisely kept the
    plane on the ground during high winds.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Despite these occasional incidents, the
    ungainly looking airplanes routinely performed their duties week
    after week, and flew one-of-a-kind, multimillion dollar cargoes
    between NASA facilities, contractor plants, and the launch site at
    Cape Kennedy. The Guppies transported other diversified cargoes in
    addition to rocket stages and engines. During 1968, the Super Guppy
    carried the special environmental chamber used for final preparation
    of the manned Apollo command module prior to launch, as well as
    carrying cryogenic tanks for an experimental nuclear rocket. As the
    Skylab orbital workshop progressed in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
    the Guppies ferried such components as the multiple docking adapter,
    the Apollo telescope mount, and the Skylab workshop itself (adapted
    from the S-IVB).</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> The success of Aero Spacelines and its original
    Pregnant Guppy attracted the attention of other firms with thoughts
    of diversification, and in July 1965 the company was acquired by the
    Unexcelled Chemical Corporation. The new organization not only
    proceeded with the Super Guppy configuration; it also constructed a
    [<A NAME="318"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">318</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] small fleet of volumetric aircraft to haul outsized
    cargoes such as large aircraft sections, jet engines, helicopters,

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although the cargoes carried by the Guppies
    were limited in number, they were unique and of considerable
    importance. In the opinion of John Goodrum, head of MSFC logistics,
    the payoff of the Guppy operations was exceptional for NASA,
    especially during the 1966-1967 period, when closely scheduled Saturn
    IB and Saturn V launches put a high premium on rapid aerial
    deliveries of S-IVB stages and instrument unit components to Cape
    Kennedy. It would be too strong to say that the Guppy operations
    saved the Saturn program, Goodrum said reflectively, but without the
    availability of the unique planes, NASA might have been forced to
    scrub some of the scheduled launches and might have incurred
    horrendous costs in money and time.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Guppy shipments of outsize components such
    as jet engines and wing sections offered a unique and highly valuable
    mode of transport in terms of commercial operations. The Guppies
    carried a limited number of otherwise awkward and critical items in
    situations where the saving of time was paramount. Nowhere was this
    capability more evident than in the nation's Apollo-Saturn
    program.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Logistics were not thoroughly analyzed at the
    start of the Apollo-Saturn program. The logistical requirements of
    Saturn parts, spares, and propellants, including the delivery of
    large rocket stages from the West Coast to the East Coast, took
    considerable manpower and unanticipated planning time. The dimensions
    of the stages required custom-built transporters, customized
    inspection equipment, and other accessories. Logistics managers
    learned to allot plenty of time for the planning and coordination
    that was necessary to move Saturn rocket stages over public
    roadways.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The extent of NASA's water and air operations
    was little known to the general public. The water routes encompassed
    passage through both the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans, and
    required negotiation of the Panama Canal, the Gulf of Mexico, and the
    Intracoastal Waterway. The waterborne routes were time-consuming, but
    remained the only feasible mode of transporting the largest of the
    Saturn stages. Saturn transportation also relied on inland waters for
    transportation between the Gulf Coast and Huntsville; logistics
    managers took advantage of canals and other waterways for the
    transfer of the S-IC and S-II stages from the manufacturing center at
    Michoud and from test areas at the Mississippi Test Facility. The
    airborne operations represented the imagination and ingenuity of the
    Saturn program. The Guppy aircraft made an invaluable.... </FONT>
