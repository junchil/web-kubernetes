    logical to narrate the story of Saturn V's various stages from the
    bottom up, beginning with the S-IC stage. However, the stages were
    not built that way. The Saturn V third stage, the S-IVB, evolved
    first, based on upper stages of the Saturn I and Saturn IB. As the

    both the Saturn IB and Saturn V evolved from the upper stage of the
    Saturn I. All three upper stages were manufactured by Douglas
    Aircraft Company, used liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as
    propellants, and shared the same basic design concepts and
    manufacturing techniques. The Saturn I upper stage (the S-IV) used a
    cluster of six engines, but the Saturn IB and Saturn V upper stages
    (designated the S-IVB for both versions) possessed a larger diameter
    and mounted a single engine of different design. During one early
    period of Saturn planning (about 1958-1959), the S-IV was planned as
    the fourth stage of a vehicle known as the C-4, but the changes and

    Alabama, on 6 January 1960, Abraham Hyatt, Deputy Director of Launch
    Vehicle Programs at NASA Headquarters, met with von Braun, Eberhard
    Rees (von Braun's technical adviser), and ABMA staff to ensure that
    S-IV contract procedures met NASA expectations. Hyatt got the ABMA
    team to loosen up a little on strict constraints that would limit the
    number of potential applicants; it was agreed that at least 20
    companies would get specific invitations to submit proposals. Any
    other company could request to participate, although Hyatt felt that
    "most companies will realize that this is a 'big league' competition
    and I doubt that there will be any companies aside from those
    selected who would seriously consider submitting a full scale
    proposal."</FONT></P>

    agreed to set up a technical evaluation team and a business
    evaluation team to analyze proposals from the various contractors. A
    source selection board, staffed by ABMA and NASA Headquarters
    representatives, would then review the findings of the evaluation
    teams and make a final recommendation to the Administrator. A
    calendar called for a bidders' conference at Huntsville, 26-27
    January, contractor proposals submitted 29 February, and source
    selection board recommendations by 1 April. ABMA was also directed to
    submit second-stage specifications, a funding plan, and a management

    to determine the precise loading and use this figure in negotiating
    final details with the winning contractor. Von Braun explained this
    situation to the first session of the bidders' conference on 26
    January. The prospective contractors got an extensive briefing from
    top NASA and ABMA managers and received a bulky packet of materials
    to use as guidelines in submitting proposals. The next day was spent

    Glennan finally based his decision on certain subjective factors. The
    findings of the Source Selection Board tended to give Convair a
    slight edge in technical competence, although Glennan remarked that
    "the Douglas proposal, in some ways, seemed more imaginative."
    Convair, however, scored lower in the business and management areas.
    No matter who was chosen, Glennan said, minor shortcomings in either
    the business or the technical areas could be easily corrected. Other
    reasons, therefore, favored Douglas.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Glennan pointed out that Convair would have a
    continuing business in liquid hydrogen rockets because of its own
    Centaur program. Moreover, the Centaur was ticketed for use in
    proposed Saturn vehicles as an upper stage called the S-V. Glennan
    apparently had a strong reservation about giving Convair the S-IV
    stage as well, because "a monopolistic position in this field seems
    possible." In short, Glennan chose Douglas because "broadening the
    industrial base in hydrogen technology is in the best national
    interest.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    that choice, stirred a minor controversy. On 12 May, the Committee on
    Science and Astronautics, House of Representatives, asked the General
    Accounting Office to investigate NASA's selection of Douglas. The
    report of the General Accounting Office, dated 22 June 1960,
    generally sustained Glennan's statements on the matter and noted that
    his decision "was consistent with the written presentation of the
    Source Selection Board and other related documents." The report also

    the idea of using six less powerful versions. Moreover, the cluster
    of six engines opened the possibilities of raising the payload
    capability and promised better inflight control. Finally, the RL-10
    type was adopted (see </FONT><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On 25 January 1962, NASA Headquarters
    confirmed the role of MSFC as the lead center to proceed with the
    two-stage C-1 and to design and develop a three-stage vehicle, the
    C-5. Mission planners envisioned a series of development flights,
    testing each stage in successive combinations before a full-dress
    flight test of the three-stage C-5 vehicles. Eventually, the C-5
    would be topped off by an improved S-IV, known as the S-IVB. For this
    stage, a single J-2 engine would provide the thrust to escape Earth
    orbit and boost a 44-metric ton payload to the vicinity of the
    moon.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> Under this scheme, the S-IVB would have been the last
    stage to be flight-tested and the "junior member" of the Saturn C-5
    vehicle when the big rocket finally lifted off as a complete stack.
    The reverse happened. The single-engine S-IVB became the real veteran
    of the Saturn program, active in more launches than any other stage.
    This was because it became part of an interim Saturn vehicle, between
    the C-1 and the C-5.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA acquired the S-IVB under a sole-source
    procurement contract with the Douglas Aircraft Company. Plans for
    this variation of the S-IV stage began with an ad hoc working group
    established at MSFC in August 1961, and NASA Headquarters approved
    Douglas as the sole-source contractor in December. The space agency
    seemed somewhat sensitive about the S-IVB contract, because there had
    been no bidders' conference or active competition by other firms.
    NASA awarded the contract to Douglas for reasons of cost and
    schedules: "The similarity of the S-IVB and S-IV stages permits the
    exploitation of both facilities and technical skills of the
    contractor now developing the S-IV stage, resulting in substantial
    savings in both time and money to NASA." In a memo to Associate
    Administrator Robert Seamans, D. Brainerd Holmes stressed the
    similarities in configurations which permitted use of the same
    tooling and materials, as well as facilities for checkout, static
    testing, and captive firing.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mission planners at NASA saw a means to
    accelerate the Apollo program by using the high-energy S-IVB stage of
    the C-1B to launch manned, Earth-orbital missions with a full-scale
    Apollo spacecraft. The [<A NAME="161"></A></FONT><B><FONT

    launched with the instrument unit (IU) segment used on the C-1, also
    provided opportunities to refine the maneuvers for the lunar
    missions. The NASA announcement of the C-1B on 11 July 1962 included
    word that lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR) was the technique chosen for
    the manned lunar landing missions with the Saturn C-5 launch vehicle.
    The S-IVB, with its capability for heavier payloads and reignition
    for translunar injection, was an important element of the LOR scheme.
    The C-1B offered a fruitful method to try out the critical
    transposition maneuver, docking of the command and service modules
    (CSM) and the lunar module (LM), and the translunar sequence of the
    S-IVB upper stage. During the summer of 1962, Douglas complied with
    MSFC directives to make the comparatively uncomplicated modifications
    of the S-IVB to fly on the C-1B vehicle. Early in February 1963, the
    "C" designation was dropped once and for all. The three Saturns now
    became the Saturn I, Saturn 1B, and Saturn V.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    operated successfully through the Mercury and Gemini programs, these
    boosters had not been designed for such missions. Nor were they

    such a vehicle were critical to the eventual success of the
    mission-especially the top stage, which inserted the payload into the
    final, stabilized orbit. Douglas engineers were emphatic. "The
    overall performance of the end-stage has greater influence than the
    primary stages. The Saturn V launch vehicle for the lunar mission
    requires 50 pounds [23 kilograms] of booster weight at liftoff for
    each pound of payload injected into a translunar trajectory," they
    explained. "Without high-energy upper stages this factor would be
    significantly greater."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.14">14</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> The key to these high-energy stages was liquid
    hydrogen as the fuel. An engineer from Douglas, the eventual
    contractor of the S-IV and the S-IVB, summed up the significance of
    the decision to use liquid hydrogen. "The combination of hydrogen and
    oxygen for propellants made the moon shot feasible," he declared.
    "Its use in upper stages results in a significant increase in
    performance over the propellant combinations of oxygen and kerosene
    then in use in first-stage boosters."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.15">15</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Many aspects of the S-IV design were
    transferred directly to the S-IVB, even though it mounted only one
    engine, instead of a cluster of six. The configurations of both upper
    stages depended on the mission requirement, and ultimately, on the
    location of the stages in the various Saturn vehicles. Originally,
    Douglas planned a 5.6-meter-diameter stage for the S-IVB, designed
    for Earth orbit rendezvous (EOR), requiring a coast in low Earth
    orbit for as long as 30 days. This permitted time for subsequent
    launches of other Saturn and Apollo hardware, rendezvous, and
    preparation for injection into lunar transfer orbit. As the mission
    profile changed from EOR to LOR, the S-IVB design requirements
    shifted to a four-day coast period, although the final mission
    profile called for a four-and-a-half hour coast in low Earth orbit,
    followed by a translunar injection burn and a two-hour period in
    translunar coast. Throughout this time of design discussions with
    MSFC, the proposed stage diameter remained at 5.6 meters, with an
    interstage to adapt to the 1O-meter diameter of the S-II stage of the
    preliminary C-5 design. Shortly before NASA's final contract
    definition of the Saturn V version, Douglas received a design change
    notice to go from a 5.6-meter version to a 6.6-meter tank. The reason
    for the change related to the mission of the interim Saturn IB, and
    the increased diameter allowed added payload capability for launching
    and testing Apollo components in Earth orbit.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The increased S-IVB capability was also
    compatible with its ultimate role in Saturn V as envisioned at MSFC.
    By 1964, the details were fairly well defined and the program manager
    for the S-IVB, Roy Godfrey, outlined them at a NASA conference in
    Houston. Briefly, the Saturn V was to place a spacecraft into a
    translunar trajectory, enable a soft landing on the moon with a
    manned payload, and return to Earth. In the mission, the S-IVB had
    two critical responsibilities: get the Apollo craft into orbit, then
    restart and insert the payload into the translunar trajectory. The
    [<A NAME="163"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">163</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] orbital phase left the S-IVB, instrument unit, and
    Apollo spacecraft in an Earth orbit of 185 kilometers, where it
    remained for about four and a half hours, or time for three orbits of
    the Earth. Following the powered flight, which consumed about half of
    the propellant, the stage relied on its auxiliary propulsion system
    during the orbital coast, to ensure proper attitude control and
    "ullage orientation" of the remaining propellants toward the bottom
    of the tank prior to engine restart-"ullage" being an old
    brewmaster's term that referred to the volume of air above a
    partially full container. After restart, the second burn put the
    S-IVB and Apollo spacecraft into the translunar trajectory and
    consumed the remainder of the propellant. With burnout of the S-IVB
    verified, the transposition maneuver was carried out-a nose-to-nose
    rendezvous of LM and CSM. Concluding this maneuver, the spent S-IVB
    and instrument unit were separated from the LM-CSM by retrofire
    ordnance aboard the S-IVB, and the mission of the Saturn V third
    stage was over.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.16">16</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The nature of the S-IVB mission imposed
    special requirements on its design. For one thing, the engine and
    stage needed the capability to restart in orbit. The stage had to
    have special equipment to ensure storage of propellants and proper
    orientation while in Earth orbit for four to five hours. The
    advantages obtained from the mission profile, primarily the coasting
    orbit and the 185-kilometer altitude outweighed the penalties. At the
    same NASA conference in Houston in 1964, the head of the
    Aero-Astrodynamics Laboratory at M5FC, E. D. Geissler, explained the
    tradeoffs in choosing this particular mission profile.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A "one shot" launch to the moon, as opposed to
    the LOR mode, had the advantage of permitting a somewhat larger
    payload. The Earth-orbital sequence carried with it a weight penalty
    of some 1360 kilograms to supply the S-IVB, IU, LM, and CSM systems
    with longevity and life support for the extra four to five hours. On
    the other hand, the "one-shot" launch had to be precisely plotted for
    liftoff at a fleeting instant of time within a given month. Injection
    in a direct lunar trajectory could take place only at a time when the
    Earth and the moon were so aligned that the liftoff point was
    precisely opposite the moon. The LOR sequence, incorporating a period
    of coasting, made liftoff much less time-critical. The time of
    departure from Earth orbit was also less critical, since the "launch
    window" in Earth orbit lasted about four hours and recurred twice
    daily. Moreover, the extra time in Earth orbit permitted more
    accurate tracking of the vehicle and allowed the mission controllers
    to plot a far more accurate start of the "burn" for insertion into
    the lunar transit trajectory. The Earth-orbital coast path of 185
    kilometers represented some compromises. Although higher orbits would
    have reduced aerodynamic heating, the orbit chosen allowed better
    tracking and telemetry.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva">164</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] of liquid hydrogen
    altered the apparent logic of tank location. The weight of the
    propellants included 87 200 kilograms of LOX and 18 000 kilograms of
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    (with some variations, depending on mission requirements). Logically,
    the layman might assume that the smaller LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> tank should be
    placed on top of the LOX tank, as was done with the RP-1 fuel and LOX
    in the S-IC first stage. The volume of the lighter
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    was much greater, however, requiring a larger vessel to hold 252 750
    liters (69 500 gallons), as compared with only 73 280 liters (20 150
    gallons) of LOX. If designers placed the LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> tank in the aft
    position, with the LOX tank above, LOX feed lines would be longer and
    would have to be run through the interior of the LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> tank (with
    additional problems of insulating the LOX lines from the colder
    liquid hydrogen). Longer LOX lines would have to be mounted
    externally between the LOX tank and the engines. Either solution
    carried a high weight penalty for long lines and associated hardware.
    It made more sense to put the fuel tank containing the
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    in the forward location, making it easier to route the
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">

    tank.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One further difference characterized the S-IV
    and S-IVB in comparison to the only other significant rocket stage
    that burned liquid hydrogen, the Centaur. The Centaur, like the
    Atlas, relied on internal pressure for rigidity and stiffness of the
    tank walls. With no pressure, the Centaur would buckle and collapse.
    The Saturn S-IV and S-IVB, like other stages, evolved as
    self-supporting structures that gave added confidence in the
    man-rating requirements. Furthermore, the various stresses placed on
    the oversized stages during erection and transportation to the launch
    pad, as well as the time-consuming checkout and countdown, were more
    tolerable.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> The S-IV and S-IVB structures owed much to an earlier
    Douglas rocket, the Thor.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although the S-IV relied on six RL-10 liquid
    hydrogen engines and the S-IVB mounted only one J-2, the choice of
    propellants remained the same. The S-IVB carried more propellant for
    a longer time, and the mission of the Saturn V, calling for restart
    in orbit, imposed some new design requirements. Stage interfaces in
    different Saturn vehicles required different skirt and interstage
    designs.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.20">20</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> The stages, however, were essentially the same. The
    delivery of the first S-IVB flight stage to NASA in 1965 was the
    culmination of a single thread of the story of the design
    fabrication, and manufacture of the S-IV and S-IVB liquid hydrogen
    upper stages.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The transfer of Thor experience to the more
    advanced S-IV and S-IVB began with the tank skins and carried into
    many related fabrication [<A NAME="165"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">165</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] and production
    techniques, including metal removal by machining and by chemical
    milling, forming by stretching and bending, welding, chemical
    bonding, and mechanical fastening.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When the Thor project entered the phase of
    design studies in the mid-1950s, engineers screened a number of
    metallurgical candidates for the rocket's propellant tanks. With its
    heritage of advanced aircraft design and production, Douglas had
    considerable expertise in handling various aluminum alloys. These
    metals and other nominees were therefore subjected to extensive test
    and analysis for use as cryogenic tankage. Adaptability for
    fabrication and inspection requirements for quality assurance were
    included in the tests. The Thor tanks not only had to be amenable to
    cryogenics with the liquid oxygen, but the tanks also had to be
    weldable. Welded joints promised the only sure way to control leaks
    of the cryogenic fuels-cryogenic leaks had a high potential of
    explosion. As it turned out, the 2014 alloy selected for the Thor
    worked so well that Douglas chose it for the S-IV and continued its
    use on the S-IVB.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.21">21</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the Thor design program, engineers
    considered several fabrication methods for the tanks, including
    conventional skin and stringer designs, as well as a monocoque style
    derived from aircraft construction. Both were rejected because of
    drawbacks of weight and construction requirements. With a design goal
    for very thin but rigid walls, Douglas finally settled on an
    integrally stiffened shell structure, using special equipment to
    literally "carve out" ribs from the inside walls of the tank. The
    wafflelike pattern that resulted was both practical and efficient.
    The waffle recesses were about 7.5 centimeters square, bounded by
    ribs that increased the buckling strength of the tank walls.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The S-IV and S-IVB featured the same
    waffle-shaped integral stiffening for their liquid hydrogen tanks,
    although designers increased the waffle size, and the S-IV skins were
    milled from 1.3-centimeter plates, as compared with 1.9-centimeter
    plates used for the S-IVB. To produce the seven separate segments for
    the S-IVB liquid hydrogen tank, Douglas used a Giddings and Lewis
    mill with a 3.6 x 12.2-meter bed and two router heads. Depending on
    particular requirements for some of the more complex areas and
    special sections for the later attachment of accessories, machining
    for each segment consumed 106 to 134 hours. In the waffle-machined
    form, the tank segments were formed to the proper curvature. To
    prevent the waffle ribs from buckling, Douglas personnel inserted
    reusable polyethylene blocks, then ran each segment through a Verson
    press for progressive forming. The Verson power brake, originally
    used in the production of various panels for the DC-8 jet aircraft,
    was unique in size for its time. Rated at 25 300 000 grams per square
    centimeter (3 600 000 pounds per square inch), it could handle sheet
    stock up to 1.9 centimeters thick and 13.4 meters long and form the
    sheets to specification with an automatic program for feed and
    contour.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="166"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">166</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The components for
    the S-IVB originated from several California locations. The liquid
    hydrogen tank segments were formed on the Verson press at Long Beach.
    The preliminary milling took place at the Douglas facility in Santa
    Monica, which also fabricated and assembled all propellant tank domes
    and bulkheads, and completed the subassembly of the liquid oxygen
    tank. Final manufacturing of S-IVB stages took place in the new
    Douglas complex at Huntington Beach, begun in January 1963
    specifically for S-IVB production. The Huntington Beach facility
    featured a distinctive architectural detail-external bracing on the
    production and assembly buildings-that enhanced cleanliness on the
    inside because there were no interior beams, supports, or braces to
    gather dust and dirt that might contaminate components during final
    assembly. Douglas funded the construction of the Huntington Beach
    facility out of its own capital reserves, and made it one of the most
    advanced aerospace plants of its kind in the United States. As for
    the other major stage contractors, Boeing operated out of the
    converted Michoud facility owned by the government, and North
    American used a mixed facility at Seal Beach. Executive and
    administrative offices owned by North American Rockwell were across
    the street from assembly and checkout areas that were leased from

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The designers of the domes for the S-IV and
    S-IVB settled on a true hemispherical shape. This design meant the
    domes were deeper and increased the overall weight of the stage (in
    contrast to the elliptical domes of the S-II stage). Douglas accepted
    this penalty in exchange for the extra strength inherent in the
    design, the possibility of a smaller diameter for the stage, and the
    resulting simplicity in tooling. The domes were composed of nine
    triangular segments, or gores, that were stretch-formed over special
    dies to accurate contours. With multiple contours, the requirements
    for partial waffle structuring of the gore segments could not be met
    by the mechanical milling. Instead, Douglas used chemical milling for
    this task, with masked segments dunked in large vats of chemicals for
    carefully calculated periods of time to remove certain areas of the
    aft LOX dome to a specified depth. Workers next moved the separate
    gore segments to a special meridian welding jig for the automatic
    welding sequence (under a plastic tent for cleanliness) that joined
    together the various segments of the aft and forward domes.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Technicians at Santa Monica performed the
    demanding job of welding the segments of the common bulkhead and
    propellant tank domes. The triangular segments, which look like
    pieces of orange peel, were placed into a welding jig for what
    appeared to be a very simple operation. Not so. "We cut our eye teeth
    on this phase of manufacturing," [<A NAME="167"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">167</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] recalled H. E.
    Bauer, a company executive who was deeply involved in the S-IV and
    IVB project. To join the metal "peels" together to form a hemispheric
    half-shell, Douglas used a rotating fixture and a "down hand"
    technique of welding. In this mode, the weld torch moved on a track
    while the molten welding "puddle" remained in the proper position
    from force of gravity, which also minimized undesirable porosity.
    While welding the orange peel segments, a strange problem developed.
    The tracking system for the weld torch hinged on the detection of
    discontinuities produced by induced eddy currents along the seams to
    be welded. The exasperating torch heads wandered all over the place,
    however, apparently unable to follow the seams at all. Oddly enough,
    the trouble was traced to manufacturing standards being set too high!
    "Because the individual segments had been so carefully formed and
    sized," Bauer explained, "upon butting them together no sensible
    level of electrical discontinuity to the instrument developed." Some
    insensitive soul suggested the application of a bastard file to rough
    up the seams and create enough discontinuity that the tracking system
    could do its job. After adamant protests from the manufacturing
    people at Long Beach, Douglas specialists refined the tracking system
    to give it a much higher gain, and scarfed (grooved) the segments to
    provide a path for the tracking sensors to
    follow.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Like Centaur, the S-IV and S-IVB relied on a
    common bulkhead to separate the fuel from the oxidizer. In more
    conventional designs, the propellants were housed in separate tanks,
    each with its own forward and aft domes and tank walls. This required
    an intertank assembly to join the tanks rigidly together as a
    complete vehicle, making for greater length and greater weight. The
    common bulkhead, in the case of the Douglas upper stages, meant a
    reduction in structural weight of up to 20 percent. Douglas developed
    a double-faced hemispherical structure, about five centimeters thick,
    with a pair of 2014-T6 aluminum shells on either side of a fiberglass
    honeycomb core. The bulkhead separated LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> at -253&#176;C
    (-423&#176;F) on one side from LOX at - 172&#176;C (-297&#176;F) on
    the other side. The common bulkhead served as an end dome for both
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    and LOX tanks, as well as insulation to prevent heat flow from the
    LOX to the colder LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">. Otherwise, the
    liquid oxygen would freeze solid. The bulkhead was designed to take
    the thermal stresses and reverse pressures, as well as to survive a
    major loss of pressure from either side. Douglas designer and
    engineer Ted Smith emphasized that the design of the common bulkhead
    originated with Douglas, independent from MSFC. Originally conceived
    for the S-IV, the bulkhead was adapted to the second-generation S-IVB
    with only minor changes for larger diameter and
    attachment.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The curved, concave aluminum shells were quite
    thin: 0.813 millimeters for the forward sheet and 1.4 millimeters for
    the aft sheet, with a 6.63-meter diameter for the S-IVB. Working with
    such large [<A NAME="168"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">168</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] diameter,
    thin-skinned sheets required exacting procedures. The complete aft
    dome sheet was set up on a bonding fixture to which the honeycomb was
    bonded. The forward dome sheet was moved into position over the
    fixture and bonded into place atop the honeycomb filler, completing
    the three-layer "sandwich" construction. This construction was, at
    least, the ideal the engineers hoped for. In practice, the milling
    and bonding of the forward dome sheet created a serious problem. The
    sheet's contours differed from the honeycomb layer underneath, and
    the aluminum skin developed an exasperatingly uneven terrain of gaps,
    gullies, and wrinkles.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.26">26</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> Douglas finally contrived a method of measuring the
    valleys and hills between the honeycomb and the forward sheet, then
    sculpting the honeycomb's contours for an acceptable fit. The
    technique was known as the "Paleno block system," involving a
    meticulous, tedious process done almost entirely by hand.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The procedure began with the top of the aft
    dome exposed before the honeycomb insulation was affixed and bonded.
    Workers then set up 350 small honeycomb blocks over the entire
    surface. Each block carried a pad of putty, encased in cellophane, on
    its top. With the putty-pad Paleno blocks in place, the forward dome
    sheet was lowered to approximate its final installation, making
    contact with each of the putty pads. The dome was hoisted up and
    workers measured the indentation on each pad to plot the variations
    in the aft dome's contours. Next the blocks were removed and the
    production honeycomb sections were fitted and bonded to the aft dome
    sheet. With templates in place to indicate the positions of the
    Paleno blocks, the honeycomb surface was "spot faced" to the Paleno
    measurements, which provided reference points for the next operation:
    sanding the entire surface by hand to the desired contours for a
    custom fit. In a wry understatement, engineers from Douglas and MSFC
    agreed: "This hand-sanding operation is time-consuming and subject to
    some human error." After cleaning, workers spread adhesive over the
    surface, and the entire common bulkhead unit went through the final
    bonding cycle at 182&#176;C (360&#176;F) inside an oversized
    autoclave. Finally, the unit was machined to the required tolerances
    on a Niles boring mill, which also machined the circumferential
    attach rings to mate the common bulkhead to the aft liquid oxygen
    dome.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    Complex at Huntington Beach, the fabricated components of the S-IVB
    finally reached the nexus of their journey, and emerged as a complete
    rocket stage. The Vehicle Tower Complex reminded the observer of the
    Vehicle Assembly Building at Cape Kennedy. Although smaller in size,
    the complex had the same immensity of scale. It was a single
    building, 36 meters high, enclosing a total of 2230 square meters.
    The interior had provisions for six large bays, each capable of
    holding a complete S-IVB vehicle, with two overhead cranes (10.1 and
    20.2 metric tons) to swing the stages to the required station.
    Basically, the bays were internal compartments to house a series of
    assembly towers, with movable work platforms at various levels in
    each. The complex included a pair of assembly and welding towers, a
    tower for hydrostatic testing, another for cleaning and degreasing,
    and a final pair of checkout towers. To control and monitor the
    activities of each tower, an elaborate vehicle checkout control room
    adjoined the complex.</FONT></P>

    personnel moved the completed S-IVB tankage assembly to the
    hydrostatic test tower for a hydrostatic test to a proof pressure
    five percent over the design load limit. Like the other manufacturing
    and test operations, the hydrostatic test was strictly programmed and
    regulated. Douglas set up a very elaborate sequence to load the
    water, with redundant automatic controls and extensive
    instrumentation. The complicated sequence did not always work. During
    one check, the tank became overpressurized and was damaged. There
    were long conferences to decide on a revised system to eliminate the
    inadvertent overpressurization.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Curiously, the satisfactory solution came not
    from more sophisticated instrumentation, but by an elementary
    approach to the problem. "After a lengthy analysis, it was decided to
    use a system so old and basic that it had almost been forgotten,"
    mused H. E. Bauer. "A standpipe-one that extended beyond the roof so
    that the tank could not be overpressurized, since the system would
    spill the excess water overboard." So a new space-age structure
    reared above the flat Pacific coastline at Huntington Beach in the
    form of an open water standpipe 43 meters high, equipped with beacons
    to warn passing aircraft, and rigged with a wire cage to discourage
    nesting birds.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Birds presented a problem in more ways than
    one. At Huntington Beach, workmen complained of misanthropic pigeons
    roosting and hovering around the rafters of the high-ceiling
    production buildings. The droppings not only created sanitation
    problems for the Saturn stages, but also for the workers. A
    hand-picked pigeon elimination section went to work on the problem.
    High-frequency whistles worked for a time, but the pigeons returned.
    Occasional indoor potshots at the ubiquitous birds produced
    humanitarian protests and holes in the roof. Workmen tried to
    pigeon-proof the building by sealing off all outside openings, but
    the persistent creatures fluttered in through gaps where the huge
    door machinery and track rails were installed. Ornithologists
    consulted on the problem finally suggested some specially treated
    seeds to affect temporarily the pigeons' nervous systems. It worked.
    After pecking at the seeds, the pigeons sat quite still for a time,
    then finally flew off, never to return. Cheerfully, the maintenance
    crews refreshed the seed supply every 60 days just to make sure their
    feathered foes kept their distance.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The odyssey of the S-IVB third stage through
    the Vehicle Tower Complex included one major interruption-the
    installation in a nearby building of the liquid hydrogen tank's
    internal insulation. This special installation process required a
    considerable amount of individual fitting by hand, and the search for
    the proper insulation materials absorbed many months of time and
    effort. The story of LH</FONT><SUB><FONT

    S-IV and IVB typifies many of the unexpected development problems
    that cropped up during the Saturn program, and illustrates the
    considerable amount of tedious handwork that went into sophisticated
    Saturn rockets.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the start of the S-IV program in 1960, the
    decision to use liquid hydrogen in the upper tank presented designers
    with a formidable insulation problem. The LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> tank was designed to
    hold 229 000 liters (63 000 gallons) of LH</FONT><SUB><FONT

    meters and weighing 17 000 kilograms. Prior to the Saturn program,
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    had been used mainly in small quantities in laboratories. Imperative
    questions emerged about its qualities when used in comparatively
    larger volume. Efficient insulation on this massive scale had many
    unknowns, and engineers at Douglas consistently recalled the
    insulation problem as a significant aspect in the evolution of the
    S-IV stage.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.30">30</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> One facet of the insulation story involved the
    composition of the insulating material, and a second related to its
    location-internal or external?</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Some of the preliminary studies at Huntsville
    envisioned the use of insulation in a dual role on the upper stage of
    the Saturn. Because the stage would have long periods in orbit,
    designers considered using external insulation as a means of
    protection from meteorites that could pierce the walls of the liquid
    hydrogen tank and perhaps touch off an explosion. The combination
    insulation-covering-and-meteorite shield would be jettisoned before
    the upper stage made its second burn for the translunar injection
    that would carry it out of the most hazardous meteorite
    zone.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.31">31</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> Nevertheless, to the engineers who opted for
    internally mounted insulation, this alternative to exterior
    application made very good sense. The insulation selection process
    also reflects several intriguing elements of the problems of
    designing, building, testing, and flying large rockets in space
    missions. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Very early in the program, internal insulation
    seemed more and more advantageous to many Douglas engineers, even
    though more was known about external types. Only one other aerospace
    firm in the country could claim any experience in the field of liquid
    hydrogen [<A NAME="173"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">173</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] propellants, and so
    Douglas personnel, accompanied by some NASA representatives, made a
    trip to San Diego to the Convair Division of General Dynamics
    Corporation. The Centaur design used exterior insulation, and the
    people at Douglas wanted to see it. Following several conferences and
    exchanges of ideas with Convair, the Douglas team became more and
    more intrigued with the possibilities of internal, as opposed to
    external, mounting of insulation. Part of the reason for this
    decision stemmed from Convair's trials and tribulations with the
    external mode and concurrent reservations on the part of NASA's Lewis
    Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. For these reasons-and a number of
    specific design factors-Douglas put the insulation on the
    inside.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.32">32</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the case of the S-IV, the basic philosophy
    emphasized simplicity and the utilization of expertise already in
    hand from previous missile and space vehicle experience. Douglas
    engineers reasoned that, first, very little was known about the
    effect of large volumes of cryogenic fluids on metals and, second,
    even less was known about insulation materials. Pursuing the goal of
    simplicity, the designers separated the problem of insulation from
    the problem of tankage structure. This separation enabled design
    experimentation in the uncharted field of insulation materials to
    proceed in one direction without forcing changes in metal structure
    configuration, which proceeded in a parallel line at the same time.
    This method also avoided the time-consuming threat of a totally new
    design approach such as double-walled tanks to combine both
    insulation and structural factors. With insulation materials being
    nonstructural, the search for a desirable insulation design had a
    wider range of possibilities.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The mission configuration itself influenced
    the insulation factor. Because the mission for which the S-IV was
    designed did not include an extended coast phase, materials with a
    wide range of thermal conductivity for a brief operational period
    could be included in the list of potential candidates. Structural
    design of the S-IV stage also enhanced the potential efficiency of
    internal insulation. The fiberglass and honeycomb construction of the
    common bulkhead yielded a very high insulation factor in separation
    of the cold LOX and the colder LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">. Further internal
    insulation on the upper LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> segment of the
    bulkhead would help reduce the tendency to solidify the warmer LOX on
    the other side.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.33">33</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As engineers began to think more and more of
    the design factors in S-IV construction and operation, internal
    insulation seemed even more attractive in terms of thermal stress
    qualities. Thermal stress was extremely critical in the filling of
    the rocket's fuel tanks when LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> at -253&#176;C
    (-423&#176;F) came into contact with tank walls at warmer ambient air
    temperatures. If insulation was external, it was feared that the
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    would create severe thermal stress and potential damage to the tank
    walls as it was pumped in, because the aluminum walls possessed a
    very high coefficient of expansion. Even if no serious weakening was
    caused by the [<A NAME="174"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">174</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] first filling,
    repeated operations could create problems, especially for vehicles
    undergoing a series of static tests and tankage checks. Internal
    installation of the S-IV's insulation would obviously eliminate many
    such problems in the tank walls. During filling, internal insulation
    promised dramatic advantages in reducing LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> loss through
    boil-off. When external insulation was used, nearly 100 percent of
    the tank's capacity had to boil off to bring the temperature of the
    walls down to -253&#176;C (-423&#176;F) to keep the
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    stable. Given the volume of tankage of the S-IV, external insulation
    meant a need for much greater quantities of expensive propellants and
    additional paraphernalia to provide a venting system to cope with the
    furious boil-off. By using internal thermal insulation, on the other
    hand, it was possible to expect only 25 percent boil-off of the
    tank's capacity, reducing the mechanical complications and all the
    other inherent drawbacks. Even with the highly efficient insulation
    finally developed for the S-IV and S-IVB, an LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> tank topped off at
    100 percent capacity before launch needed constant replenishment,
    since the boil-off required compensation at rates up to 1100 liters
    (300 gallons) per minute.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even with the tank finally filled, the design
    team foresaw additional problems with external insulation. If it
    became damaged and the metal underneath was exposed, that extremely
    cold area would tend to pull air into the damaged section. The air
    would liquefy and freeze, making a larger cryogenic surface, which
    would attract even more air, liquefaction, and icing. The whole
    process threatened to create an unacceptable situation of thermal
    losses around the damaged area, thermal instability, and a hazardous
    problem during ground operations.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The repeated fill-and-drain operations
    associated with testing and boil-off conditions raised the
    requirements not only for insulation materials, but also for
    adhesives. When Douglas began its catalog of materials and
    alternative modes of installation, no satisfactory adhesives could be
    found to bond external insulation to the outside walls of a tank
    filled with cryogenic fuel. On the inside, however, where the fuel
    made contact with insulation and not metal, the insulation created a
    warmer bond line where it touched the interior wall surface. In this
    more congenial environment, available adhesives would work. Even the
    plans for the test-firing operations of the S-IV program presented
    special problems to be solved. Because of the S-IV's volume of
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    fuels, a new system had to be devised to store large quantities of
    liquid hydrogen for repeated test firings and to transfer it to the
    stages set up in the test stand.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.34">34</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The process of frequently repeated testing and
    acceptance checks, as well as final loading prior to launch,
    encouraged Douglas engineers to shift toward internal insulation as a
    means of minimizing potential damage to the insulation from normal
    external handling. For example, external insulation seemed
    susceptible to degradation during the handling
    [<A NAME="175"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">175</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] and transportation of the vehicle through the test
    and checkout phase, to say nothing of the degradation and cracking to
    be expected from atmospheric exposure as the rocket stage moved
    through these procedures and into the long transportation phase from
    California to the Cape for launch. Testing programs indicated that
    interior mounting yielded extra margins of reliability even if an
    accidental break in the insulation materials occurred. The cryogenic
    liquid coming into contact with the warmer tank wall became gaseous,
    and itself acted as insulation against further contact, thus reducing
    the thermodynamic loss.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.35">35</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Meanwhile, the search for an effective
    insulation material continued. At one point, balsa wood was a leading
    candidate. Balsa had all the primary characteristics for good
    insulation: lightness, ease of shaping, and insulative capacity. But
    there was a question of adequate supply of the right kind of balsa.
    Each S-IV liquid hydrogen tank was 5.5 meters in diameter and 10
    meters long. S-IVB tanks were 6.7 meters in diameter and 12.2 meters
    long. Obviously, a considerable amount of balsa would be required
    during production, and no one was completely sure that current stocks
    of balsa would suffice. A special task force analyzed the available
    data and reluctantly reported that the combined harvests of the balsa
    forests all over South America fell short. Even as the data were
    being analyzed, balsa was losing its allure. Lab testing revealed
    internal wood flaws and other deficiencies that made it less and less
    desirable as insulation. Still, the balsalike qualities of lightness,
    insulative characteristics, and ease of shaping were goals of the
    Douglas engineers in their quest for the perfect material, available
    in quantity. As Ted Smith put it, "We set out to manufacture
    synthetic balsa."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After conducting tests of a number of
    potential materials, Douglas technicians finally devised their own
    insulation. To form workable masses of insulation material, they
    contrived a three-dimensional matrix of fiberglass threads, woven
    onto a boxlike form reminiscent of a child's weaving frame-top to
    bottom as well as back and forth. After it was strung, the matrix
    frame was placed in a mold, and polyurethane foam was poured in and
    cured. The result was a reinforced foam block, 30 centimeters square
    and 20 centimeters deep, which could be sawed into a pile of flat
    plaques, then machined to the required convex and concave contours
    appropriate for the interior of the S-IV liquid hydrogen tank. The
    recessed waffle pattern construction of the tank's interior required
    special attention in shaping each tile to fit. Using a machine tool
    with custom fixtures and cutters, operators recessed edges and cut
    steps on [<A NAME="176"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">176</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] each tile. The
    tiles then slipped into the appropriate indentation in the waffle
    pattern and still covered the notched step cut of each adjoining tile
    for a smooth surface. The waffle pattern included some variations in
    design, requiring each of the 4300 tiles to be numbered and
    individually shaped to its unique position inside the
    tank.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.37">37</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> In cutting the tiles, Douglas discovered a true case
    of serendipity-the saw cuts left small ends of the fiberglass threads
    sticking out around the edges, which served admirably to engage the
    adhesive as each tile was installed.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.38">38</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">An insulation facility provided an
    environmentally controlled work area during the installation process.
    Technicians with protective gloves and shoe covers entered the tank
    through an opening in the forward section, then began laying tile in
    the aft area near the common bulkhead, working their way back to the
    entry point. The numbered tiles, attached to a conveyor belt, were
    coated with adhesive by an automatic applicator set up in an
    adjoining room, then traveled via the conveyor into the tank to be
    affixed "by the numbers."</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During this procedure, the installation
    facility's environmental control equipment maintained the tank's
    interior temperature at 13&#176;C to 18&#176;C (55&#176;F to
    65&#176;F) to extend the adhesive's effective life. Once a section
    had been completely tiled, workers applied a special fiberglass cloth
    liner, then retired while a vacuum bag pressed the tile further into
    the waffle recesses and the tank temperature rose to 43&#176;C
    (110&#176;F) to set the adhesive. Machinery then rolled the tank
    around its axis to a new position, and another installation cycle
    began. Final steps in the operation included application of a
    fiberglass cloth (impregnated with resin) as a sealant over the
    insulation tiles, another curing period, and a concluding cure cycle
    at 71&#176;C (160&#176;F) for 24 hours. Using mounts that remained
    exposed above the insulation, fitters completed installation of
    valves, helium bottles, and other hardware before a last cleaning
    cycle in the degreasing tower. After the sensitive fuel-level probes
    were inserted, technicians sealed off the fuel tank at the top with a

    stage operation of the S-IVB were similar to the more conventional
    LOX-RP-1 operations. The introduction of liquid hydrogen necessitated
    some new techniques, however, and the differences in upper stages
    introduced additional design variations. The ubiquitous S-IVB upper
    stage, sharing the J-2 powerplant with the S-II stage, exemplified
    the nature of stage systems required for Saturn vehicle missions,
    particularly the Saturn V. Saturn V's S-IVB included six basic
    systems: propulsion, flight control, electrical power,
    instrumentation and telemetry, environmental control, and
    ordnance.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Effective operation of the J-2 engine depended
    on the ability of S-IVB to manage the supply of liquid oxygen and
    liquid hydrogen on board. The propulsion system included not only the
    J-2 engine but also the propellant supply system, a pneumatic control
    system, and a propellant utilization system (PU system). The LOX
    propellant tank could take 72 700 liters (20 000 gallons) of liquid
    oxygen, loaded after a preliminary purge and prechill cycle. For
    launch, the tank was filled in four separate phases, calculated to
    accommodate the interaction of cryogenic propellants with the tank
    walls and associated equipment. The slow fill sequence, at 1800
    liters per minute (500 gallons per minute), raised the propellant
    volume to 5 percent capacity, and the fast fill sequence, at 3600
    liters per minute (1000 gallons per minute), continued to 98 percent
    of the tank's capacity. The tank was topped off at 0 to 1100 liters
    per minute (0 to 300 gallons per minute) and replenished as required
    at 0 to 110 liters per minute (0 to 30 gallons per minute) until
    launch. A single fill-and-drain line could fulfill all requirements
    and disconnect automatically at the time of launch. The fuel tank of

    helium supply came from the nine helium bottles submerged in the
    liquid hydrogen tank. During engine operation, a special engine heat

    J-2 LOX turbopump assembly before both the first J-2 burn and the

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With two kinds of propellants aboard a
    liquid-propelled rocket, designers wanted both tanks to run dry at
    the same time so as not to compromise mission performance. Residual
    amounts left in either of the tanks would subtract from the accuracy
    and stability of a desired trajectory or orbit. As a mechanism for
    propellant management, Saturn liquid hydrogen stages relied on the
    propellant utilization system. Developed for the S-IV, the PU system
    was used in both versions of the S-IVB, as well as the S-II second
    stage. Its primary function was simple: "to assure simultaneous
    depletion of propellants by controlling the LOX flow rate of the J-2
    engine." With a PU probe located in both the LOX and
    LH</FONT><SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva">
    tanks during propellant loading operations, the system also provided
    information about the propellant mass accumulating aboard the
    stage.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Prior to the development of the S-IV,
    ballistic missiles that used kerosene and LOX propellants
    incorporated an "open loop" propellant utilization. PU rates were
    analytically determined on the basis of the powerplant, payload, and
    mission profile and were confirmed after many
    [<A NAME="181"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">181</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] flight tests. Operational vehicles were then loaded
    with propellants to meet calculated goals for varying missions and
    targets; small errors were acceptable. This approach was simply not
    satisfactory for the S-IV. In the first place, high costs ruled out a
    long series of test flights to establish an accurate utilization
    curve. In the second place, the use of LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> presented too many
    variables in loading operations and during orbital coast missions. It
    was estimated that the stage could end up with 1360 kilograms of
    residual propellants in an open-loop configuration-a serious weight
    penalty for an Apollo-Saturn mission. So the S-IV design team decided
    on a "closed loop" PU system to regulate the propellants in flight
    and thus to ensure the positive depletion of both tanks. The PU
    system would continuously sense the amount of propellant in each tank
    and regulate the engine mixture ratio to come as close as possible to
    simultaneous depletion.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The decision to use a capacitance sensor
    followed an exhaustive examination of alternative liquid gauges.
    Although capacitance gauges were familiar in industrial and aircraft
    operations, the S-IV was the first to use it in the PU system for
    rocket vehicles. The cryogenic propellants posed a number of problems
    that led designers almost inexorably to a capacitance gauge. Sensors
    to indicate fluid levels could not take into account the variations
    in the tank geometry. Furthermore, standard sensors simply could not
    cope with sloshing during flight and "boiling" effects that
    constantly altered the liquid-level line. Designers also discarded
    the possibility of density sensors at the bottom of the propellant
    tanks, because the density of cryogenics was apt to vary from one
    point to another inside the same tank. The PU capacitance probe, an
    original Douglas design, was intended to overcome these problems
    through the use of a "gauging system which measured mass by
    integrating a fluid property related to density over the length of
    the tank." The PU capacitance probe could literally "read" the
    dielectric constant of the propellants in the tanks.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Despite its accuracy, the PU system was
    primarily used for loading and monitoring propellants in flight.

    its attitude control and thrust vector steering from correction
    signals originating in the instrument unit. The vehicle was steered
    by hydraulic actuator assemblies that gimbaled the J-2 engine. The
    hydraulic equipment included both electric and engine-driven pumps,
    as well as an auxiliary pump. The design of the hydraulic actuators
    owed much to the insistence of engineers at MSFC. When Douglas began
    design work on the S-IV actuators, the company developed a unit that
    was slim and long, very similar to the actuators that Douglas had
    perfected for landing gear in airplanes. The Huntsville design group,
    relying on their past experience with the Redstone and other rockets,
    argued that thrust levels and mission environment of the S-IV called
    for shorter, thicker actuators. Sure enough, the Douglas actuators
    developed some unacceptable instabilities. The company finally
    subcontracted the work to Moog Industries, who built the actuators to
    MSFC specifications.</FONT></P>

    The stage carried one transmitter, using two antennas. During
    staging, some of the data were lost in transmission, and similar
    losses occurred during parts of the low Earth orbit. To acquire as
    much information as possible during each mission, the S-IVB carried a
    digital data acquisition system that recorded sample data pertaining
    to stage operation, then played it back when in range of ground
    stations. The telemetry and other electrical equipment was kept from

    temperature-controlled air in the aft skirt and interstage during
    countdown and coolant fluid in the forward skirt, circulated from
    equipment during countdown and flight. Before liftoff, the

    and the forward skirt with gaseous nitrogen, which cleared them of
    combustible gases accumulated during propellant loading and storage.

    lost during a flight mission. The phenomenal success of the Saturn
    program probably owed most to two basic philosophies: (I) the
    stringent reliability and quality assurance programs during
    manufacture, and (2) exhaustive ground testing. Emil Hellebrand, of
    MSFC's Science and Engineering Laboratory, stressed the significance
    and economy of comprehensive testing at a meeting of the NASA Science
    and Technology Advisory Committee in Houston in June 1964. At that
    time, the Saturn I had completed six flights, including two launches
    with the S-IV second stage and its advanced liquid hydrogen engines.
    Aside from a minimum of problems, the 100-percent record of success
    vindicated the thoroughness of the drawn-out testing program, and
    Hellebrand advocated similar stringent programs for the succeeding
    generations of Saturn vehicles. "Money spent on well planned and

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Each stage required its own testing program,
    tailored to the mission objectives and characteristics of the stage
    itself. Overall, the test phase of the Saturn program accounted for
    as much as 50 percent of the total effort, in terms of allotted
    man-hours and physical resources. This high figure reflected the
    intensity of the effort to reduce the risks inherent in the manned
    Apollo-Saturn program. In general, the respective Saturn stages
    progressed through three major test phases: ground test, static
    firing, and demonstration flight test. In the case of the S-IV and
    S-IVB, five different test configurations of the stage verified the
    manufacturing sequences as well as the overall design. A "structural
    test cylinder" was produced to check the ability of the tankage to
    take compressive forces of loading and storing cryogenic propellants.
    A "facilities stage" allowed other contractors and MSFC to work out
    interface problems, as did mating and launch facilities at Kennedy
    Space Center (KSC). An "all-systems stage" permitted tests of the
    general compatibility of vehicle equipment, pneumatic control
    systems, and other features. The "dynamic test stage" afforded
    engineers the opportunity to determine vibration characteristics
    during the launch and mission trajectory. The static-test-firing
    stage, or "battleship" stage constructed of heavy gauge stainless
    steel, allowed earliest possible test firing to verify major
    components of the propulsion systems and engines and to identify
    design changes required to improve performance and reliability.
    Because these various test items were more often than not undergoing
    simultaneous test and evaluation, MSFC and the contractors had to
    work carefully to ensure integration of design changes before
    committing themselves to production of the flight-stage
    configuration.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The earlier battleship phase allowed
    propulsion tests to run independently of the schedule for
    flight-weight structures, and gave engineers the chance to begin
    tests of the propulsion systems as much as 9 to 12 months earlier
    than anticipated. The steel sinews of the battleship articles also
    yielded a strength factor and safety margins that allowed
    installation of some components before their rigorous qualification.
    For the second phase of static firing, engineers introduced actual
    flight hardware-the "all systems" test.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These static tests for Douglas stages took
    place at the company's own Sacramento Test Operations (SACTO). The
    company made significant progress in automated checkout and countdown
    (see </FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="ch13.htm">chapter
    13</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">), and in the handling and storage
    of the quantities of cryogenics required for S-IV and IVB tests. One
    of the ticklish problems of working with large rocket stages filled
    with liquid hydrogen concerned the danger of hydrogen leaks. As one
    authority on rocket fuel wrote, "All sorts of precautions have to be
    taken to make sure that oxygen doesn't get into
    [<A NAME="185"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">185</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] the stuff, freeze, and produce a murderously touchy
    explosive." There was an added, perverse character about leaks that
    produced hydrogen fires-in daylight, the flame was invisible. It was
    possible to inadvertently blunder into the searing flame. As Harold
    Felix, who managed SACTO operations in the late 1960s, put it, "You
    don't want to go into a countdown of firing if you got leaks. It is a
    good way to blow up stages." But how to detect an invisible fire?
    Douglas used infrared TV cameras, but they still did not provide
    visibility at every angle. Just to make certain, SACTO had a special
    examination crew, outfitted with protective clothing and equipped
    with brooms. The men "walked down" the stage, from the top
    scaffolding to the bottom, extending their brooms ahead of them. If
    the broom suddenly sprouted into flame, the men knew they had
    discovered a hydrogen leak. Still, accidents could happen, even when
    extra precaution was taken.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    1964, was intended to use both the S-I and S-IV stages live, the S-IV
    all-systems vehicle was given extra scrutiny and analysis. In a
    countdown for the test firing of an S-IV all-systems vehicle at SACTO
    on 24 January 1964, the vehicle exploded and burned. Once before,
    large quantities of LOX-LH</FONT><SUB><FONT

    exploded, but that had been at several thousand meters during the
    first Centaur launch, and the incident had not lent itself to close
    observation and evaluation. So the incident at SACTO was carefully
    scrutinized. W. R. Lucas and J. B. Gayle, both of MSFC, headed the
    investigating team of 11 members from Douglas and NASA. They traced
    the cause to an overpressurized LOX tank. At the time of the
    accident, tape records showed the pressure to be considerably above
    the design limits of the S-IV tank. Watching films taken during the
    test sequence, the investigators spotted a rupture in the peripheral
    area of the common bulkhead, and the nearly instantaneous flash of
    the explosion. The LH</FONT><SUB><FONT

    conjectured that the SA-5 launch could reasonably proceed, with
    special attention to LOX tank pressures during countdown at Cape

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the Saturn IB and S-IVB also got under way,
    Douglas began fabrication of the first flight version in September
    1964. In addition to changes in some of the electronics systems, the
    basic evolution of the [<A NAME="186"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">186</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] S-IVB from the
    second stage of the Saturn IB to the third stage of the Saturn V
    involved interface requirements with the larger diameter of the
    Saturn V second stage and the controls to ensure the restart of the
    J-2 engine for the translunar trajectory burn. The S-IVB third stage
    profited heavily from S-IVB second-stage battleship tests. The tests
    went well- with one catastrophic exception. Just as the S-IV test
    program experienced the loss of a complete stage, the S-IVB test
    program also lost a stage. This time it was a flight stage,
    S-IVB-503.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With the S-IVB-503 in position at Test Stand
    Beta III at SACTO, the Saturn V's third stage was scheduled for
    acceptance testing on 20 January 1967. The terminal countdown went
    perfectly, but about 150 seconds into the simulated mission, and
    prior to stage ignition, the stage countdown was aborted because of a
    faulty computer tape mechanism. The Douglas crew successfully
    corrected the computer difficulty, recycled the test, and began
    again. With the terminal countdown once more unwinding, all systems
    reported normal. Eleven seconds before the simulated liftoff
    occurred, however, the stage abruptly exploded in a fiery blast of
    smoke and debris. Most of the stage was blown completely out and away
    from the test stand, with only jagged shards of metal left hanging.
    Adjacent service structures lost roofs and windows, and the nearby
    Beta II stand was so severely damaged that it was shut down. Within
    three days of the incident, another special investigation team
    convened at SACTO to analyze the probable cause.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The group finally traced the source of the
    explosion to one of the eight ambient-temperature helium storage
    spheres located on the thrust structure of the J-2 engine. The
    exploding sphere ruptured the propellant fill lines, allowing liquid
    oxygen and liquid hydrogen to mix and ignite, setting off an
    explosion that wrecked the stage. Further analysis showed that the
    sphere had been welded with pure titanium weld material, rather than
    the alloy material specified. The helium sphere and the weld seam had
    been previously tested to withstand extremely high overpressures, but
    repeated tests on the sphere prior to the acceptance firing sequence
    had created the weakness that ultimately resulted in disintegration
    of the sphere and destruction of the stage. With this information in
    hand, Douglas and NASA personnel agreed on revised welding
    specifications and quality control for the helium spheres.
    Replacement spheres were built in-house at Douglas from then

    full-duration acceptance test firing of the first S-IVB flight stage
    marked the first time that a fully automatic system was used to
    perform the complete checkout, propellant loading and static firing
    of a space vehicle." The burn of the S-IVB-201 stage lasted 452

    were by far the most dramatic element of the Saturn V test program.
    They were also some of the most expensive. The cost of static firing
    the S-IVB alone came to $3.2 million for each stage. Keeping a close
    watch on the funding from his vantage point in Washington, Apollo
    Program Director, Major General Sam Phillips, questioned MSFC about
    continuing this expensive practice. In his reply, Brigadier General
    Edmund F. O'Connor, Marshall's Director of Industrial Operations,
    reminded Phillips that the incentive and performance clauses in
    existing contracts with stage manufacturers would be so expensive to
    renegotiate and rewrite that early savings simply would not accrue if
    the static-firing requirement was ended. Also, cryogenic calibration
    occurred during the static test operations, and these expensive
    calibration operations, using a full load of cryogenic propellants,
    would have to be done in any case. O'Connor pointed out that static
    tests and postfire checkout frequently exposed shortcomings that
    might have caused the loss of the mission. Even during propellant
    loading, problems cropped up. Elimination of static firing would mean
    that vehicle hardware got its first exposure to full cryogenic loads
    while the vehicle sat on the pad, only hours away from ignition and
    liftoff-not a propitious time to discover a leaky hose or faulty
    valve. O'Connor won his point. For the time being, static firing
    continued.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the evolution of the hydrogen-fueled S-IV
    and S-IVB, Douglas drafted its designs against the mission profile
    and general requirements established by the Marshall Space Flight
    Center. Douglas engineers were not always happy with the close
    technical monitoring from Huntsville, a strong characteristic of the
    Marshall team. Differences were inevitable, given the pride and
    confidence of personnel on both the contractor's side and the
    customer's side. In retrospect, Douglas personnel emphasized their
    role in pushing ahead in many technical areas, apart from
    contributions by their counterparts in MSFC's well-equipped
    laboratories. Douglas people also emphasized their independence from
    Convair in the development and production of liquid- hydrogen-fueled
    upper stages, though Douglas did learn from Convair's experience.
    Contractor research carried out under the aegis of NASA was not
    proprietary; under NASA cognizance, Douglas and Convair held a number
    of technical discussions. The resident MSFC representative at
    Douglas, O. S. Tyson, accompanied Douglas personnel during such
    exchanges, including excursions to static-firing test
    sites.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.59">59</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Because both the Centaur and the S-IV carried
    the same RL-10 engine, a strong tendency to follow Centaur's general
    design concepts persisted. Earl Wilson, one of the design engineers
    at Douglas, said that [<A NAME="189"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">189</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] he had to fight
    hard to keep the Douglas S-IV from looking like another Centaur.
    Nevertheless, Wilson affirmed the cooperation of Convair and
    especially appreciated the collaboration of Pratt &amp; Whitney
    technical representatives in establishing the different RL-10 format
    for the S-IV stage.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.60">60</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Ted Smith, another leading Douglas engineer,
    was less willing to acknowledge a debt to Centaur. Douglas gained no
    substantial design factors from Convair, he explained, primarily
    because the S-IV stage was a much larger and more complex rocket
    system. The Centaur was closer to the missile experience of its
    creator, Convair, and also to its immediate predecessor, the Atlas.
    Atlas and Centaur parallels were evident in the thin-skinned,
    pressurized-tank concept, as well as the basic philosophy of the
    design of the common bulkhead in each. At Douglas, the S-IV design
    absorbed the propellants, engine system, and even the common bulkhead
    concept, but the Centaur and S-IV structures had marked differences.
    The S-IV was much more akin to Douglas's earlier experience with the
    Thor vehicle in terms of structural design materials and fabrication
    of the tankage. Moreover, the Centaur was a comparatively small
    vehicle. The S-IV was rather large, for its time, and the tankage
    concept was extrapolated from the Thor
    development.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#6.61">61</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> Even though the Centaur also featured a common
    bulkhead separating LH</FONT><SUB><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUB><FONT FACE="Geneva"> and LOX within the
    same tankage structure, Hal Bauer noted the different S-IV honeycomb
    design. This feature relied on prior Douglas applications in aircraft
    wing panels and some phases of earlier missile design, although the
    extent of the honeycomb installation in a concave form was unique for
    its time, Bauer pointed out.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The size of the original S-IV was significant
    but largely overshadowed in light of subsequent evolution of the
    Saturn V stages, the S-IC and the S-II. It should be remembered that
    the Saturn I and Saturn IB, with the S-I and S-IB first stages,
    respectively, relied on the somewhat makeshift design approach of
    clustered tanks to supply the requisite volume of propellant. The
    S-IV tankage was unique. Nothing that size had previously been
    attempted for any American rocket, and the liquid hydrogen fuel
    created unique design challenges. In many respects, then, the S-IV
    emerged as the first really definitive rocket stage of the Saturn
    program. It did not begin with a feasibility study; it was not a case
    of joining together existing tankage components and proven engines.
    The S-IV evolved as a result of requirements established by a
    comparatively elaborate mission profile, an untried engine design and
    exotic propellant combination, and unusual size. Its success, so
    early in the program, was a notable achievement of the manned space
    program and a credit to NASA, MSFC, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Douglas
    Aircraft Company.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The special significance of the S-IV extended
    very quickly into the heart of the Apollo program. As noted earlier,
    the upper stage of the Saturn V played the final, truly critical role
    of the Saturn vehicle's job: [<A NAME="190"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">190</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Earth orbit of the
    vital payload; then, a second burn for the translunar trajectory.
    This was the role of the eventual Saturn V third stage, the S-IVB,
    whose technology sprang from the recent technological past. "Just as
    Thor technology led us to the S-IV," Hal Bauer wrote, "the S-IV led
    to the S-IVB." The technological knowledge and development experience
    came from the half-dozen S-IV stages of the Saturn I program. The
    S-IV and S-IVB possessed the same basic design fundamentals,
    including internal insulation, the forward and aft domes, and the
    common bulkhead. S-IVB manager, Roy Godfrey, also underscored the
    experience with the S-IV that established high NASA confidence in its
    successor. "Of prime importance has been the opportunity to observe
    and analyze the performance of the S-IV stage," Godfrey stated,
    "which formed the foundation upon which the S-IVB detailed design was
    built."</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In comparing the S-IV to the S-IVB, there was
    a strong consensus among those who worked on both that the `more
    advanced' S-IVB was, nevertheless, simpler. The earlier upper stage,
    with its cluster of six engines, created more design tangles than the
    single-engine S-IVB, even though the latter had to have the
    capability to restart in space. Some of the instrumentation for the
    S-IVB was more sophisticated, but aside from the engine, there were
    no major differences between the two. The electronics, including the
    circuitry and design for the propellant utilization probe, for
    example, passed easily from the S-IV to the
    S-IVB.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    the case in other Saturn V stages. The S-IC first stage and the S-II
    second stage shared a common diameter, but there the resemblance
    stopped. They were built by different contractors, used different
    propellant systems, and had different mission requirements and
