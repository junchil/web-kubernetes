    first Saturn V, lifted off from Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy
    Space Center on 9 November 1967. After several weeks of trial and
    error, the launch capped a countdown that experienced no serious
    holds or delays. The prime mission objectives for the Apollo 4 launch
    vehicle were to verify the first "all up" test of the Saturn V,
    including all three stages and the instrument unit. The mission
    objectives also emphasized the qualification of Launch Complex 39 and
    its ground support equipment, as well as the first orbital reignition
    of the S-IVB third stage as configured for the Saturn V. The launch
    of Apollo 4 included a number of "firsts." For TV viewers, the most
    visible events were the ignition and liftoff of the vehicle itself,
    the word from Mission Control in Houston that the spacecraft had
    entered its simulated lunar trajectory, and the successful reentry
    and splashdown of the command module. However, as mission director
    William C. Schneider remarked, these events represented only the tip
    of the iceberg. "Most of the things we were proving were below the
    surface," he explained, "not readily apparent to public
    view."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Before an airplane entered operational
    service, hundreds or even thousands of hours of flight testing proved
    its air worthiness. For each Apollo-Saturn launch, every component
    aboard the vehicle was making its first and last flight. For this
    reason, the weeks, months, and years of ground testing were
    necessary, and for this reason, the vast array of telemetry was
    necessary to evaluate the performance of parts and systems that could
    never be flown again or even recovered for postflight
    analysis.</FONT></P>

    had tremendous significance. It was not only the first Saturn V but
    it also tested several major systems for the first time in an
    "all-up" configuration. As one observer described it, "The all-up
    concept is, in essence, a calculated gamble, a leap-frogging
    philosophy which advocates compression of a number of lunar landing
    preliminaries into one flight. It balances the uncertainties of a
    number of first-time operations against a `confidence factor' based
    on the degree of the equipment reliability achieved through the most
    exhaustive ground-test program in aerospace history." If NASA had
    followed prior custom, the S-IC first stage might have been launched
    by itself, testing the concept of the five clustered F-1 engines,
    each of which had a thrust nearly equal to that of the entire first
    stage of the Saturn IB. Then a two-stage vehicle would be launched to
    try out the clustered J-2 engines of the liquid-hydrogen-fueled S-II
    second stage. Next the three-stage booster would be launched, and
    finally the entire Apollo-Saturn vehicle including the CSM. This
    program would have entailed four separate flights, 12 months extra
    for preflight preparations, and analysis of postflight data for each
    launch-all this running into hundreds of millions of
    dollars.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The concept of the all-up launch did not
    originate with von Braun or with MSFC, but came from the experience
    of George E. Mueller, who took up his new duties as Director of the
    Office of Manned Space Flight for NASA on 3 September 1963. When
    Mueller took office, NASA was faced with extreme budgetary pressures.
    The request submitted originally to President Kennedy had totaled
    $5.75 billion. In the hectic months following Kennedy's
    assassination, President Johnson had a very short time for making a
    multitude of decisions and experienced heavy pressure from Congress
    to reduce federal expenditures. One influential senator, not a friend
    of the space program, informed the President that unless NASA
    expenditures were kept under $5 billion for the next year, Johnson
    would lose the senator's vote for the tax bill-and the President
    wanted that bill very much. These financial pressures on the Johnson
    administration constitute one reason for all-up testing. As James
    Webb recalled, "Under these circumstances, NASA made a complete
    reevaluation of its plans for the NASA program and decided to revise
    it, going to the very advanced and, to some, risky approach of the
    `all-up systems test' procedure for the Saturn V-Apollo combination."
    It seemed to be the only way to achieve the lunar landing within the
    decade. Moreover, it imposed a stronger discipline on the contractors
    and on NASA itself. Even so, Webb admitted, "It was a very bold
    move."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#12.3">3</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Obviously, budgetary constraints played a
    large role in the all-up decision. On the other hand, this procedure
    also matched Mueller's background in rocket development and testing.
    Before joining NASA, Mueller had been with the Space Technology
    Laboratories in Redondo, [<A NAME="349"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">349</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] California, where
    he had been in charge of a number of technical operations for various
    Air Force missile programs. These included the Thor, Atlas, Titan,
    and Minuteman ballistic missiles. The all-up concept had been
    introduced in the development of the Titan II missile and was being
    written into the development plan for the Minuteman
    ICBM.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#12.4">4</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the fall of 1963, the flight-test sequence
    for the Saturn launch vehicles was based on a plan issued by Brainerd
    Holmes, Mueller's predecessor. The Holmes plan reflected the
    conservative philosophy of the Marshall Space Flight Center, which
    tested new vehicles step by step. In the case of the Saturn IB, for
    example, the plan called for two launches, one in August 1965 with
    both stages live but still utilizing a guidance system from the
    Saturn I. The second Saturn IB would be launched late in 1965 with
    the same configuration, and the operational Saturn IB with a
    prototype instrument unit was not to be flown until January 1966. The
    same plan called for the first Saturn V launch in March 1966, with a
    live first stage, inert second and third stages, and a prototype
    instrument unit. The second Saturn V launch, scheduled for July 1966,
    was to have live first and second stages, an inert third stage, and a
    prototype instrument unit. As Mueller settled into his new job, he
    came to the conclusion that the financial consequences and the time
    consumption of the step-by-step approach simply could not meet the
    national goal of a lunar landing by the end of the decade. "It was
    pretty clear," Mueller said, "that there was no way of getting from
    where we were to where we wanted to be unless we did some drastically
    different things, one of which was all-up
    testing."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#12.5">5</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It did not take Mueller long to act. On 1
    November 1963, in office less than a month, Mueller dispatched a
    priority teletype to the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center,
    Houston; Launch Operations Center, Cocoa Beach, Florida; and Marshall
    Space Flight Center, Huntsville: "Subject: Revised manned spaceflight
    schedule. Recent schedule and budget reviews have resulted in a
    deletion of the Saturn I manned flight program and realignment of
    schedules and flight mission assignments on the Saturn IB and Saturn
    V programs." The teletype directed that the first Saturn IB flight,
    SA-201, and the first Saturn V flight, AS-501, should comprise all
    live stages, and both should carry complete spacecraft. Mueller also
    indicated that he wanted the first manned Saturn IB flight to be
    AS-203. For Saturn V, he wanted the first manned flight to be AS-503.
    In other words, Mueller was suggesting that the first manned flights
    in each series occur on the third launch, instead of the seventh.
    Mueller asked for responses to his proposed schedule by 11 November
    and concluded with the comment, "My goal is to have an official
    schedule reflecting the philosophy outlined here by November 25,
    1963."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> The arrival of Mueller's teletype at Huntsville caused
    a furor comparable only to the debate on Earth orbit rendezvous
    versus lunar orbit rendezvous (EOR-LOR).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="350"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">350</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The first occasion
    for von Braun to discuss the message with his top staff occurred on
    Monday, 4 November, at the staff luncheon. A lively and occasionally
    rancorous debate continued for the next several days. The Mueller
    idea went against the approach of the von Braun team, steeped in a
    step-by-step, conservative philosophy of flight testing. Before the
    V-2 was operational, dozens of test rounds had been fired; many
    remembered the numerous abortive launches suffered in the early
    development period of Redstone and Jupiter. The chance of failure on
    the inaugural Saturn V seemed too high, and the financial risk too
    great. As recalled by Bob Young, Chief of Industrial Operations at
    the time, the reaction among von Braun's senior technical staff was
    "one of shock and incredulity." The general reaction seemed to be,
    "It is simply not done that way." The meetings, and the debate,
    continued. Walter Haeussermann, for example, pointed out that it was
    difficult to predict the rate of success for an all-up launch. How
    was it possible, for instance, to assign the probability of success
    or failure for a first stage on the first flight? Other people
    groused about the limited time available, and there was continuing
    concern about the workability of liquid hydrogen-particularly in the
    S-II second stage with its cluster of five engines. There was still
    some question about the degree of readiness of the instrument unit.
    One individual close to the discussions at this time, Frank Williams,
    said that he could not remember anyone who thought it was a good idea
    or that it would work at all.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The initial consensus at MSFC was to oppose
    the all-up decision. Bob Young recollected that both von Braun and
    Rees were low keyed in voicing their doubts, but in the end they
    sided with Mueller. Rees, in retrospect, stressed the time element in
    particular. He pointed out that the original approach would have
    required reconfiguring the launch site for every launch. The time
    involved in this reworking would have made a landing on the moon
    within the decade very doubtful. Still, there was considerable
    ambivalence on the part of the senior staff at Marshall Space Flight
    Center. Dieter Grau seems to have summed up the situation most
    accurately. "I'm not aware," he wrote years later, "that a consensus
    was obtained on this subject in favor of the all-up concept, although
    I know that Dr. von Braun went on record for the Center supporting
    this concept eventually. Just as Dr. Mueller could not guarantee that
    this concept would succeed, the opponents could not guarantee that it
    would fail. Dr. Mueller wanted to eliminate the additional costs
    which a more cautious approach would have required and Dr. von Braun
    decided MSFC should share the risk with him." The decision was
    declared to be MSFC policy, even though doubts continued to be
    expressed by many at Huntsville.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#12.7">7</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> Without saying so, von Braun himself still harbored
    some concerns.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By 8 November, von Braun was ready with the
    interim response that Mueller had requested. "There is no fundamental
    reason why we cannot [<A NAME="351"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">351</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] fly 'all-up' on the
    first flight, von Braun wrote. Nevertheless, he urged the importance
    that a "fall back" position should also be maintained, if some
    problem developed in a technical area with scheduling or in funding
    before the launch of AS-501.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#12.8">8</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> Before sending the letter, however, von Braun called
    Mueller, read him the draft and discussed the various issues
    involved. He reminded Mueller that details were somewhat sketchy,
    because the program under discussion was a multibillion dollar
    program with dozens of contractors, and it was difficult to rethink
    such a radical change and reschedule everything in less than a week.
    Mueller acknowledged the tentative character of the discussion and
    was reassured by von Braun's description of Marshall's consensus.
    Stretching things a bit, von Braun told him, "Our development team
    here with whom we discussed everything in much detail is solidly
    behind the all-up flight concept."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#12.9">9</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although correspondence between Marshall and
    NASA Headquarters continued to endorse the all-up principle and
    in-house memorandums at Huntsville encouraged commitment to it, there
    was still some sniping from von Braun's senior management. When
    Mueller and Robert Seamans, NASA Associate Administrator, visited
    Marshall early in December 1963, the Saturn V Program Manager, Arthur
    Rudolph, raised the issue again. He steered Seamans over to a corner
    where a model of the Saturn V was standing next to a model of the
    Minuteman on the same scale and discoursed on the comparative
    simplicity of solid-propellant rockets as opposed to the complexity
    of liquid chemical rockets the size of the Saturn V. His doubts about
    the all-up concept were implicit. He paused dramatically, turned to
    Seamans and said, "Now really, Bob!" Seamans got the point. "I see
    what you mean, Arthur," he said. Encouraged, Rudolph buttonholed
    Mueller, drew him over to the same models and repeated his discourse
    about the relative merits and disadvantages of each. Mueller was
    unimpressed. "So what?" he responded.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">From the time of Mueller's all-up teletype of
    1 November 1963, it was four years, one week, and one day until the
    launch of AS-501. The interim was filled with exhaustive research and
    development of Saturn V systems, subsystems, and components. At
    Kennedy Space Center, a parallel effort involved the construction and
    verification of Launch Complex 39. Prior to the arrival of the AS-501
    vehicle, the facilities had received a comprehensive checkout using
    an interim Saturn V facilities [<A NAME="352"></A></FONT><B><FONT

    invaluable information prior to the first operational launch of
    AS-501. Nevertheless, NASA management realized that the launch of the

    were made for extraordinarily detailed experience reports. According

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the meantime, Saturn V stages began
    arriving at KSC. All did not go well. Problems with hardware caused
    considerable delays and postponement of the launch date. In March
    1967, an agenda for a briefing on AS-501, to be attended by General
    Phillips, included mention of 1200 problems resulting in 32
    discrepancy reports. The memo to Phillips indicated that work teams
    had divided the problems into four separate categories and planned to
    work them off at an intensive rate of 80 per day. A typical problem
    was the discovery of an errant bolt in one of the F-1 engines and the
    requirement to see how it got there to make sure that nothing similar
    would happen again.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> Then in June 1967, after the AS-501 vehicle had
    already been stacked, it was necessary to take it down. On the West
    Coast, North American Rockwell had discovered some 80 weld flaws in
    the S-II second stage, designated S-II-6; it developed that S-II-1,
    already sitting in the AS-501 stack, had similar flaws. This costly
    delay nearly escalated when Boeing decided to follow up on its own
    stage, the S-IC, and discovered similar difficulties. Subsequent
    tests gave the S-IC-1 a clean bill of health, but not without a
    flurry of concern for the status of AS-501. Late in the month, NASA
    Headquarters issued a special directive calling for better management
    of the hardware changes on the AS-501 vehicle. In an attempt to keep
    the launch schedule on an even track, the teletype message warned,
    "It is essential that change traffic of all types be reduced to only
    those changes which are mandatory for safety or mission
    success."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    demonstration test (CDDT) on AS-501 brought out additional
    difficulties which, as Program Manager Rudolph admitted, "caused
    numerous holds, delays, crew fatigue, scrubs, and recycles." Three
    recycles were required and instead of about one week, three weeks
    were needed to complete the test. Everything, Rudolph said,
    encountered difficulties-the Saturn V, the spacecraft, the launch
    facility, everything. Rudolph contended, however, that he was not
    surprised. It was, after all, the first time that a multitude of
    components were integrated into a "super system." On the first stage,
    for example, a number of the propellant valves opened simultaneously
    instead of in sequence as had been intended. On the second stage,
    items within the S-II were damaged by filling the LOX tanks too
    rapidly. In the third stage, cable connections were shorted as a
    result of the accumulation of moisture in the environment of the
    launch site. The instrument unit had difficulty in the environmental
    control system designed to keep the electronics in black boxes cool
    during operation of the vehicle. In the ground support equipment, a
    malfunction prevented proper pressure in the helium bottles, and the
    ground computer's problems included "intermittent operation due to

    the Public Affairs Office, Julian Scheer, met with Administrator Webb
    and representatives of the Office of Manned Space Flight in a heated

    less than a week before liftoff, on 2 November, MSFC started worrying
    about leaks in the seal rings of LOX fill and drain valves caused by
    aging of the Teflon over the long time that AS-501 had been on the
    launch pad. Concern was expressed about the batteries of the S-II
    stage for the same reason. Although these and other problems were
    subsequently solved, it put the count approximately 40 hours behind

    prelaunch experience with AS-501, Rudolph ticked off the lessons
    learned. The prolonged holds and recycling of the count wore out
    critical components with short lifetimes. For this reason,
    continuously updated logistical plans had to be prepared. Rudolph
    asserted that production components in many cases did not live up to
    the standards attributed to them by the qualification test program.
    He warned that the suppliers had to maintain much stricter
    [<A NAME="354"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">354</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] manufacturing control and quality control to prevent
    degradation of such equipment. A number of problems resulted from the
    first-time conditions at Cape Kennedy. Work crews had to redesign
    many items "on the spot" while constrained by complicated procedural
    changes under pressure of the countdown. To launch successfully,
    concluded Rudolph, it was necessary to plan built-in holds, not only
    to replace components but also to prevent fatigue of the

    propellant per second. The cluster of five F-1 engines, which put out
    33.4 million newtons (7.5 million pounds) of thrust, performed their
    operation for only 150 seconds, although each of the engines was
    tested for an average of 650 seconds of static firing before a
    launch. NASA also figured in a lifetime factor of 1400 seconds as a
    confidence factor for each engine. The only limiting factor was
    therefore the amount of propellant that could be crammed into the
    S-IC first stage.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The first stage boasted its own set of
    gargantuan statistics. Its girth was ample enough to allow three big
    moving vans to drive, side by side, into the first stage tank. The
    LOX tank of the first stage held enough liquid oxygen to fill at
    least 34 railroad tank cars (or 54, depending on which handout was
    read). To get the fuel from the tanks to the engines, the pumps on
    the S-IC first stage worked with the force of 30 diesel locomotives,
    and some of the fuel lines and associated valves were big enough for
    a man to crawl through. Fully fueled and running, the S-IC first
    stage turned out the equivalent of 119 million kilowatts (160 million
    horsepower)-twice as much power as all the rivers and streams of
    America running through hydroelectric turbines at the same
    time.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In trying to visualize the size of the Saturn
    V rocket, writers most frequently compared it in height to a 36-story
    building, or noted that it towered well above the Statue of Liberty,
    and weighed 13 times as much. A public relations pamphlet issued by
    North American Rockwell included the information that "6 200 000 lbs.
    is over 3000 tons; a good-sized Navy destroyer is only 2200 tons.
    Which gives you a fair idea of how much weight will have to be lifted
    off the ground before the Apollo spacecraft can be boosted into
    orbit, then shot almost 11 400 statute miles out into space and
    intricately maneuvered during the Apollo 4 flight." In terms of space
    payload capability, a writer for Fortune magazine pointed out that
    the Saturn V could lift "1500 Sputniks on a single launch, or

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">To make the most of the first Saturn V flight,
    data collection was also geared up to astronomical capabilities.
    During the Mercury test program, for example, data were received on
    the ground at a rate that would fill a standard printed page every
    second. The Apollo-Saturn vehicle was designed to relay some 300
    pages of data in one second. The research, design, manufacturing,
    test, and preparation leading to the moment when the rocket was
    poised for its leap into space had required the services of over 300
    000 scientists, engineers, technicians, and craftsmen, representing
    over 20 000 companies. The estimated cost for the AS-501 vehicle was
    $135 million for the rocket and $45 million for the
    spacecraft.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    Apollo-Saturn program and the trials and tribulations of getting the

    for the final preparations. The inherent risks of the all-up concept
    seemed to multiply the chances for total failure. The electric
    tension of the atmosphere heightened perceptibly with the influx of
    VIPs. Congressional figures, the diplomatic corps and other foreign
    visitors, industry executives, and NASA managers began arriving at
    the Cape. Late in the afternoon of 6 November, von Braun left
    Huntsville in NASA's Gulfstream No. 3. After arrival at Patrick Air
    Force Base, von Braun was scheduled for an exclusive executive dinner
    and conference. The next day, Tuesday, 7 November, included further
    executive sessions with the Office of Manned Space Flight and other
    contractor personnel. Early in the morning of 8 November 1967, the
    final 24-hour countdown period for AS-501 began. The day included a
    major press conference at the Vertical Assembly Building, and, late
    in the evening, a dinner for top-level NASA personnel and industry
    representatives.</FONT></P>

    AS-501 faded with the setting sun, but as darkness descended over the

    accounts. In W. C. Schneider's first teletyped 24-hour report, the
    opening sentence told the story: "The Apollo 4 mission was
    successfully accomplished on 9 November 1967." Talking to reporters
    later, he called AS-501 a bench mark to aim for in succeeding

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The flight marked the initial flight testing
    of the S-IC and S-II stages; the S-IVB was essentially the same as
    that used in the Saturn IB launches. The first-stage S-IC performed
    with the accuracy anticipated by launch officials. A timer cut off
    the center F-1 engine at 135.5 seconds into the flight, and the
    outboard engines cut off at LOX depletion in 150.8 seconds, when the
    vehicle had recorded 9660 kilometers per hour at an altitude of 61.6
    kilometers. The separation of the first stage took place only 1.2
    seconds off the predicted time lines, and the cameras aboard the S-II
    showed a clean separation of the stages. Other major systems of the
    S-IC, including the pneumatic control pressure system,
    pressurization, and propellant utilization, performed within
    acceptable ranges. On the S-II second stage, the cluster of five J-2
    liquid-hydrogen engines achieved perfect sequencing for engine start
    and burn. Two slight variations were observed by ground controllers:
    engine-start bottle pressures were somewhat higher than predicted,
    and the temperatures of the thrust chamber jackets increased at rates
    higher than predicted. Neither of these minor anomalies exceeded the
    operational limits of the Saturn V; all other systems performed
    normally. Cutoff for the S-II occurred at 519.8 seconds, about 3.5
    seconds later than indicated on the
    [<A NAME="358"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">358</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] mission control sheets. The troublesome external
    insulation on the liquid-hydrogen tank of the S-II stage survived the
    countdown and launch with no recorded failures.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Variations in the S-IVB third-stage
    performance were greater than those of the lower stages. In achieving
    orbit, the guidance control system ended the first third-stage burn a
    few seconds beyond the predicted shutdown point, when the stage
    achieved a speed exceeding 27 000 kilometers per hour at an altitude
    of 192 kilometers. Prior to the restart sequence, after two
    revolutions in Earth orbit, telemetry received at Cape Kennedy
    indicated that the liquid-hydrogen ullage pressure was somewhat below
    the anticipated minimum and that the status of the helium
    repressurization spheres was below normal for S-IVB restart
    preparations. Mission personnel decided that the engine could be
    reignited in spite of the deficiencies, and the third stage respond
    successfully. The instrument unit (IU) ended the second burn several
    seconds short of the expected duration, reacting to the earlier
    extended burn of the S-II stage, made at higher thrust levels of the
    J-2 five-engine cluster, which enabled the third stage to make its
    mission profile with less burn time required. The IU operated
    exceptionally well with only 40 questionable measurements and single
    pair of confirmed failures out of about 2862 measurements made during
    the Saturn V portion of the mission.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#12.27">27</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Behind the primary mission objectives, NASA
    personnel closely monitored many individual items of flight hardware.
    Of singular importance was the experience of coordinating the
    platoons of NASA and contractor personnel during the long months of
    prelaunch operations. Even as the painstaking procedure of checking
    out each stage and every item in the stage progressed, launch
    engineers were evaluating the procedures themselves on this first
    Saturn V mission. The mobile launch concept was only one example.
    Planned and orchestrated to reduce the time the vehicle remained on
    the launch pad and exposed to the effects of corrosion, dust, and
    weather, the concept required that the Saturn V be assembled and
    checked out inside the huge VAB. With the huge vehicle complete, the
    plan called for mobility to reposition the complete vehicle on the
    launch pad, 5.5 kilometers distant. This meant the use of the
    crawler, bearing the combined launcher and vehicle out to the pad.
    The launch itself the holddown arms for the first time. Not only did
    the arms stabilize the vehicle during rollout to the pad and keep the
    vehicle in place during the long countdown, but they also held down
    the straining vehicle after ignition until computers verified
    satisfactory operation of the engines and signaled release of the
    rocket. The strain was so intense that the mobile launcher was
    actually stretched about 20 centimeters.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The mission also tested the gimbal capability
    of the engines. The vehicle had to make a roll maneuver around its
    vertical axis after launch and pitch into an inclined northeasterly
    trajectory after climbing away [<A NAME="359"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">359</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] from the launch
    pad. Before ignition of the J-2 engines of the second stage, mission
    personnel closely watched the second-stage ullage maneuver. Following
    separation of the first and second stages, the nearly weightless
    propellants tended to surge forward, climbing the propellant tank
    walls as acceleration decreased. Unless the propellants were settled
    once more against the propellant line inlets to the engines, no
    second-stage ignition could occur. So the eight ullage rockets had to
    fire first, accelerating the stage and forcing the propellants into
    place. The system worked, and the five J-2 engines burned as
    expected. The emergency launch escape tower jettisoned perfectly, and
    the third stage performed like the veteran it was. The IU for the
    Saturn V functioned just as planned, and reignition of the S-IVB
    third stage represented another crucial test: the second burn would
    supply the acceleration required for the translunar
    trajectory.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The S-IVB reignition had appeared to be a
    particularly difficult sequence. The behavior of hydrogen in orbit
    was a problem, and the restart sequence depended on especially
    designed, complex equipment. After its first burn, cutoff, and
    three-hour coast through space, the J-2 had to be reconditioned to
    cryogenic temperatures before the final restart sequence began. To
    purge the engine of contaminants remaining after the first burn, an
    automatic sequence initiated a helium purge, and a gaseous hydrogen
    start tank was refilled by a tap line from the stage's hydrogen
    tanks. Valves opened to permit liquid hydrogen and oxygen to trickle
    through the engine and cool down its parts to the requisite cryogenic
    temperatures. During an ullage maneuver to seat the propellants for
    entry into the pumps, an automatic sequence ran a final check on
    temperatures, pressure levels, and other engine conditions to verify
    the readiness of the engine and propellant systems. When the IU
    received positive indication on all the numerous readings required,
    it triggered the final start sequence for reignition. Apollo 4 proved
    the restart capability, and the second burn put the spacecraft into a
    very high elliptical orbit, reaching more than 16 000 kilometers from
    Earth. With its mission complete, the S-IVB separated from the
    spacecraft, which performed its own programmed burns and maneuvers
    before CSM-CM separation and CM reentry.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    created by the rocky research and development of the S-II second
    stage, the disastrous fire at Cape Kennedy early in 1967, and the
    troublesome experiences with the countdown demonstration tests of the
    AS-501 vehicle late in 1967, the flawless mission of Apollo 4 elated
    the entire NASA organization; everyone looked ahead with buoyant
    spirits. Returning to Huntsville, von Braun received a call from
    Brainerd Holmes on 15 November. "Congratulations! That was such a

    Brainerd exclaimed. Von Braun warmly responded that it showed the

    president of the Boeing Company, George Mueller pointed with pleasure
    to the success of the all-up concept, and continued in glowing terms
    about the success of the industry-government team. The mission of
    Apollo 4, Mueller emphasized, was a true landmark, ".... a very large
    step forward. It is, in my view, the most significant single
    milestone of the Apollo-Saturn program." Urging continued dedication
    to the task ahead, Mueller closed with the remark that it was
    possible to fulfill the national commitment of landing Americans on
    the moon and returning them safely to Earth within the

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the meantime, planning continued for the
    flight of the second Saturn V mission, to be known as AS-502, or
    Apollo 6. In the aftermath of the AS-501 flight, NASA planners were
    optimistic in planning for the next two missions, both of which were
    to be unmanned. General Phillips advised NASA center directors that
    if AS-502 was successful, AS-503 would become the first Saturn V
    manned mission. Thus, AS-502 served as an all-important dress
    rehearsal for the first manned flight.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The general euphoria was badly worn by the
    problem-prone mission of AS-502. Nothing had indicated the impending
    series of trials ahead. After a satisfactory countdown, AS-502
    blasted off from Launch Complex 39 on schedule, early in the morning
    of 4 April 1968. The first thing to go awry was the S-IC first stage,
    which developed longitudinal oscillations of five cycles per second
    during the last moments of the first-stage burn. These oscillations,
    known as the "Pogo effect," had occurred on the first Saturn V, but
    their magnitude on AS-502 became alarming. "The second Saturn V's
    takeoff at the Cape was faultless," von Braun recalled. "For two
    minutes everything looked like a repeat of the first Saturn V's
    textbook performance. Then a feeling of apprehension rolled through
    the launch control center when, around the 125th second, telemetered
    signals from accelerometers indicated an apparently mild Pogo
    vibration." The lengthwise oscillation lasted less than 10
    seconds.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After the moments of concern about the
    first-stage Pogo readings, launch personnel felt better about the
    stage separation and ignition of the five J-2 engines on the S-II
    second stage. After burning 4.5 minutes, however, the number two
    engine began to develop unwholesome problems. The engine began to
    falter; it lost thrust and then shut down. No more than a second
    later, the number three engine suddenly shut off as well. To
    compensate for the loss of 40 percent of its thrust, the IU steered
    [<A NAME="361"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">361</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] the faltering second stage into a recomputed
    trajectory to reach the programmed altitude for third-stage
    separation. After some overtime firing, the S-II finally shut down
    its three remaining engines and fell back from the S-IVB. The third
    stage fired up normally, and the S-IVB, IU, and payload finally made
    it into an Earth parking orbit, although a somewhat lopsided one.
    After two orbits, the bird received a command for the third stage to
    reignite. Nothing happened. The J-2 engine just would not restart,
    despite repeated efforts. Salvaging all that was available from the
    flight, mission controllers succeeded in separating the CSM from the
    malfunctioning third stage, got a couple of burns out of the service
    module engine to get the command module into better position for the
    reentry tests, and finally brought the CM through reentry and
    splashdown to verify the heat shield.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Had the flight been manned, the astronauts
    would have returned safely," von Braun emphasized afterward, "but the
    flight clearly left a lot to be desired. With three engines out, we
    just cannot go to the Moon."</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the aftermath of the marginal flight of
    AS-502, teams went to work to find answers to the problems. Pogo had
    been encountered previously in Titan-Gemini and other launch
    vehicles, and a fix was likely in the future. However, the J-2 engine
    failures involved a problem of unknown origins and causes, indicating
    the need for some intensive sleuthing.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Armed with reams of reports and telemetry data
    from the AS-502 flight, the J-2 problem team assembled, including
    engineers from MSFC and Rocketdyne. The record of temperature
    readings from thermocouples in the S-II tail section provided the
    tipoff, beginning at the 70th second of flight, when investigators
    discovered telltale indications of a flow of cold gas. Such a
    phenomenon could only come from a leak of liquid-hydrogen fuel, and
    the leak was located in the upper regions of the number two engine.
    Even more conclusive was the coincidence of increased cold flow from
    about the 110th second on, when ground controllers first noticed the
    falter of thrust. Clinching the theory of a fuel leak, the J-2 team
    found indication that a split second before the number two engine
    shutdown, hot gas had erupted in the area of the leak. The only
    theory to explain a hot gas eruption, followed by engine shutdown,
    was the failure of the J-2 igniter line in the upper part of the
    engine.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These data allowed the J-2 group to
    reconstruct the sequence of the failure. The leaking fuel line,
    leading to the igniter, sprayed the upper engine section with liquid
    hydrogen, even though some fuel continued through the line and the
    engine kept burning. Finally, the line broke completely, and fiery,
    high-pressure gas from the combustion chamber backed up and spurted
    through the rupture. Combustion chamber pressure began to fall off,
    so that the low-thrust sensing equipment triggered a sequence to shut
    down the engine by closing the fuel and oxidizer valves. The
    electrical sequence to close number two LOX valve
    [<A NAME="362"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">362</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] went erroneously to number three. Closing the fuel
    valve for engine number two and the LOX valve for engine number three
    shut down both engines. Telemetry from the J-2 engine on the third
    stage told the same story as engine number two of the second stage: a
    failed igniter line. The S-IVB had arrived in orbit before the
    failure was complete, but could not restart the engine.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The MSFC and Rocketdyne investigation team now
    knew how the engines and igniter fuel lines failed, but no one could
    say why. Engineers set up special test stands to wring out the fuel
    lines again. The tests began by subjecting the igniter fuel lines to
    successively higher pressures, flow rates, and vibration, surpassing
    the extremes that might reasonably be encountered during a mission.
    The lines survived the punishment. Next, the investigators checked
    into the possibility of resonance failures, concentrating on the
    bellows sections in the lines. The accordionlike sections, located
    near either end of the line, were intended to provide flexibility for
    expansion and contraction, and engineers wondered if some flow rates
    could induce "buzzing" in the bellow-a phenomenon that, if
    sufficiently severe, could cause metal fatigue and failure. There was
    buzzing, but the lines held. Finally, Rocketdyne technicians decided
    to test the lines in a vacuum chamber, in close simulation of the
    environment where failure occurred. Eight lines were set up for test
    in a vacuum chamber, and engineers began to pump liquid hydrogen
    through them at operational rates and pressures. Before 100 seconds
    elapsed, each of the eight lines broke; each time, the failure
    occurred in one of the bellows sections. By using motion picture
    coverage acquired during repeated vacuum chamber tests, Rocketdyne
    finally could explain the failures.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The igniter fuel lines were installed on the
    engine with protective metal braid around the bellows section. When
    tested in a chamber that was not in a vacuum condition, the
    surrounding air was liquefied by the extremely cold liquid hydrogen
    flowing through the lines and was trapped between the bellows and the
    protective metal braid. This condition clamped subsequent vibration
    in the fuel line. When tested in the vacuum chamber, where the
    environment simulated the conditions of space, there was no liquefied
    air to dampen the destructive resonance. A redesigned igniter fuel
    line eliminated the bellows sections, replacing them with bends in
    the line to allow for expansion and contraction during the
    mission.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Concurrent with the J-2 failure investigation,
    a Pogo task force, with representatives from MSFC and other NASA
    agencies, the contractors, industry, and universities, analyzed the
    first-stage F-1 engines and the overall Saturn V vehicle. The Pogo
    phenomenon, they reported, originated from two sources. While F-1
    engines burned, the thrust chamber and combustion chamber of each
    engine developed a natural vibration of some 5.5 hertz. Further, the
    whole vehicle vibrated in flight with a
    [<A NAME="363"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">363</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] varying frequency that peaked at 5.25 hertz around
    125 seconds into the flight. When the engine frequency closely
    matched the structural frequency, Pogo vibrations appeared up and
    down the entire vehicle. The vibration was not in itself destructive,
    but it did increase the stresses on the vehicle and the astronaut
    crew, because the lighter spacecraft, perched at the tip of the tall
    rocket, was buffeted more than the engines at the bottom. The team
    investigating Pogo concluded that they should "detune" the engine
    frequencies away from those of the structural frequencies.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The group explored a number of possible fixes
    before settling on pneumatic "shock absorbers" in the LOX lines
    leading to each of the five F-1 engines in the first stage. The
    so-called shock absorbers made use of cavities in the LOX line
    prevalve assembly. The prevalve assembly contained a bulging casting
    in the LOX line to accommodate the movement of a big valve that
    opened or closed the LOX line. During engine operation, with the
    valve in the open position, liquid oxygen filled the casting's cavity
    to about half its volume. Engineers tapped the first stage's ample
    helium supply (used to pressurize the fuel tank), and filled the
    remainder of the valve cavity with helium gas. The helium gas in the
    cavity acted as a shock absorber by clamping the engine pulsations
    into the LOX lines and into the vehicle structure.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At Mississippi Test Facility, engineers
    successfully demonstrated the two fixes during August 1968, with test
    firing of the S-IC first stage equipped with the Pogo suppression
    equipment on the F-1 engines, and the S-II second stage with the
    redesigned igniter fuel lines on the J-2 engines. The demonstration
    cleared the way for a manned launch of AS-503, as Apollo 8. The
    AS-503 was planned to place the manned CSM in a low Earth orbit. If
    the interim Apollo 7 mission, boosted by a Saturn IB, verified the
    redesigned CSM and its new safety features, then the Saturn V-Apollo
    8 mission could be revised boldly. "There is even a remote
    possibility of a spectacular swing around the Moon by the manned
    spacecraft," von Braun said in the autumn, a little over a month
    before the scheduled launch. "That a mission as bold as the last is
    even considered, for the first Saturn V to be manned, bespeaks
    planners' confidence that all about it has been set
    aright."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    Armstrong, command module pilot Michael Collins, and lunar module

    the standard chronology of such aerospace events, Astronautics and

    only a few lines to the Saturn V launch vehicle. The stars of the

    Collins was struck again by the enormity of the vehicle that was to
    carry them aloft:</FONT></P>

       graceful, suspended by a cross fire of search lights which made it
       sparkle like a delicate opal and silver necklace against the black
       sky. Today it is a machine again solid and businesslike, and big.
       Over three times as tall as a Gemini-Titan, taller than a football

    1969. The number of observers around the launch site was
    conservatively estimated at a million, including 200 congressmen, 60
    ambassadors, 19 governors, 40 mayors, and other public figures.
    Vice-President Spiro T. Agnew and former President and Mrs. Lyndon B.
    Johnson were there. Live television coverage of the liftoff was
    beamed to 33 countries on six continents

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Inside the spacecraft, Collins was very much
    aware of the gimbaling of the F-1 engines below, separated from the
    command module by the length of a football field. Watching prior
    Saturn launches, he had been impressed by the rigid and stately
    progress of the rocket off the pad. From the inside, the ride was
    jiggly and caused a kind of twittering feeling because of the
    gimbaling engines. There was not as much noise as Collins had
    expected, although it probably would have been difficult to
    communicate without the intercom. The Saturn ride, he reported, was a
    bit softer than the ride he had experienced in the Titan-Gemini
    launches. During the boost phase, the crew watched the gimbaling
    rates of the F-1 engines to make sure that no dangerous deviations
    from the course occurred, the flow rates of the propellants, and the
    thrust levels of the rocket engines. The first 10 seconds of the
    liftoff concerned the astronauts somewhat because the Saturn V rose
    so close to the umbilical tower. After that point, the crew relaxed a
    bit, and the noise and motion of the rapidly climbing rocket abated.
    Collins noted to himself that all the lights and dials indicated no
    problems. "All three of us are very quiet-none of us seems to feel
    any jubilation at having left the earth, only a heightened awareness
    of what lies ahead."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#12.46">46</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the long months of astronaut training,
    the emphasis had been on operations and control of the spacecraft. It
    had not been necessary for the crew members to become experts on each
    of the booster stages. Still, because the Saturn V was going to be
    the prime mover of the mission, the crew picked up odds and ends of
    information and formed an opinion about it.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As far as Collins was concerned, the Saturn V
    vehicle itself had been the largest question mark in the
    Apollo-Saturn program. If there had been trouble with the command
    module or with the lunar excursion module, it would have been
    possible to have found a fix on it in a matter of months. If one of
    the huge, complex, Saturn V's had blown up, however, during one of
    the R&amp;D launches, for example, then several years would have been
    required to have made a fix. According to Collins, "the Saturn V
    loomed in our minds as being the biggest single unknown factor in the
    whole lunar landing program." Now, as the Apollo 11 vehicle soared
    upward, consuming tons of propellants in the S-IC booster, the next
    concern was the S-II boost phase. "Staging, it is called, and it's
    always a bit of a shock, as one set of engines shuts down and another
    five spring into action in their place," Collins explained. "We are
    jerked forward against our straps, then lowered gently again as the
    second stage begins its journey. This is the stage which whisperers
    have told us to distrust, the stage of the brittle aluminum, but it
    seems to be holding together, and besides, it's smooth as glass, as
    quiet and serene as any rocket ride can
    [<A NAME="371"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">371</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] be." Although Collins and others had the feeling that
    the S-II was probably going to be the weakest link in the chain of
    the three stages of the Saturn V, Collins had been very much
    encouraged with the fervor of workers at North American Rockwell. He
    was impressed by their hard work and impressed by the way they caught
    up with the time lags in the S-II program. Still, all that talk about
    brittle aluminum and cracks in the S-II tankage left a few nagging
    thoughts. The S-II performed beautifully, however, leading up to the
    end of its boost phase and the staging of the S-IVB.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nine minutes into the mission, the second
    stage shut down, and the crew waited, weightless, for the ignition
    and acceleration of the S-IVB third stage. Although third-stage
    ignition occurred on schedule, the momentary wait seemed interminable
    to the expectant astronauts. When the S-IVB ignited, the acceleration
    softly pushed the crew back into their contoured seats. The third
    stage, as Collins described it, had "a character all its own," with
    more crispness and rattles than the second stage. After 11 minutes
    and 42 seconds, the S-IVB single J-2 engine completed its first burn
    and switched itself off. The astronauts were in orbit, gently
    restrained by the couch straps, with a stunning view of the world
    through the spacecraft windows.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#12.47">47</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Over Australia the crew received word that
    they were "go" for the translunar injection (TLI) to boost the
    spacecraft out of Earth parking orbit into the trajectory to take it
    to the moon. This procedure required a second burn of the S-IVB. As
    the spacecraft swept out over the Pacific Ocean, the Saturn prepared
    to pump hydrogen and oxygen to the J-2 engine and meticulously
    dictated the orientation of the spacecraft by computers. The crew had
    no control over the vehicle at this point and were merely observers
    of the flickering lights on the panel indicating that the Saturn was
    counting itself down to ignition. When the J-2 finally started up,
    Neil Armstrong emitted a heartfelt "whew." Collins felt both relief
    and tension that they were on their way to the moon, one more hurdle
    behind them, as long as the S-IVB continued to burn. "If it shuts
    down prematurely," Collins speculated, "we will be in deep yogurt,"
    ending up in a kind of odd-ball trajectory that would take some fancy
    computations on the part of Houston and the crew members to get back
    on track and set up for a reentry to Earth. Collins was amazed to see
    flashes and sparks of light, evidence of the thrusting engine mounted
    on the tail of the vehicle 33 meters below him. Abruptly a sudden
    lurch, like the shifting of gears, indicated that the Saturn had gone
    into a programmed shift in the ratio of fuel to oxidizer flowing to
    the engine. "Marvelous machine!" Collins thought to himself. "It's
    pushing us back into our seats with almost the same force we are
    accustomed to on earth (one G), although it feels like more than
    that. It's still not smooth, 'just a little tiny bit rattly,' says
    Buzz, but it's getting the job done and our computer is spewing out
    numbers which are very close to perfection."
    [<A NAME="372"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">372</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] The shaking was more noticeable in the final moments
    of the ride, but ended with a good shutdown of the engine. "Hey,
    Houston, Apollo 11. That Saturn gave us a magnificent ride,"
    Armstrong exclaimed.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On 20 July, as the spacecraft passed around
    the far side of the moon, Armstrong and Aldrin separated the lunar
    module from the command and service modules and began their descent
    for the lunar landing, leaving Collins in a station-keeping orbit
    above. During the final approach, the crew realized that the lunar
    module was headed toward a large, inhospitable crater filled with
    boulders. Taking over manual control of the descent rate and
    horizontal velocity, Armstrong steered toward a landing site several
    kilometers away from the original target area. At 4:18 p.m. EDT, the
    lunar module touched down. Armstrong reported to Earth: "Houston,
    Tranquility Base here-the Eagle has landed." With obvious relief,
    Mission Control in Houston called back: "Roger, Tranquility. We copy
    you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We are
    breathing again. Thanks a lot." Television cameras attached to the
    lunar module were oriented to catch Armstrong as he crawled out of
    the spacecraft. At 10:56 p.m. EDT, Armstrong stood on the lunar
    surface. "That's one small step for man-one giant leap for
    mankind."</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Armstrong was joined by Aldrin several minutes
    later, and the two men carried out a brief ceremony, unveiling a
    plaque fixed on one of the LM struts ("Here men from the planet earth
    first set foot on the moon July 1969, A.D. We came in peace for all
    mankind."), and set up a small U.S. flag. During their stay on the
    moon, Armstrong and Aldrin deployed a series of scientific
    experiments and picked up assorted surface material and chunks of
    rock, along with two core samples, all totaling about 24 kilograms.
    Their tasks accomplished, the pair of astronauts took off in the LM
    early in the afternoon of 21 July. Following the rendezvous in lunar
    orbit, Armstrong and Aldrin joined Collins in the CSM. The LM ascent
    stage was jettisoned, and a CSM engine burn on 22 July put them on a
    trajectory back to Earth. The command module made its programmed
    separation from the service module on the morning of 24 July 1969,
    and Apollo 11 splashed down in the middle of the Pacific, only 24
    kilometers from the recovery ship U.S.S. Hornet, at 12:51 p.m. EDT.

    not to say that there were no variations among vehicles or changes
    from one vehicle to the next. Adjustments were made in timing,
    sequences, propellant flow rates, mission parameters, trajectories.
    There was continued modification and refinement in the course of the
    program. Each mission also produced a list of malfunctions,
    anomalies, and significant deviations that required certain
    configuration or operational changes. Engines and other equipment
    were constantly submitted to fine tuning to ensure and enhance their
    proper operation in flight. It is interesting to note, for example,
    that the thrust of individual engines varied even within a vehicle
    and from one mission to another, as technicians continued to adjust
    and change their operational characteristics.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The remaining six vehicles in the
    Apollo-Saturn program reflected this low-profile improvement and
    modification program. There were no major vehicle changes, and no
    catastrophic perturbations in the operational history of the Saturn V
    launch vehicles, although there were still dramatic moments and small
    problems that continued to crop up from time to time. The flight of
    Apollo 12 was electrifying, to say the least. Before it got away on
    14 November 1969, the vehicle had been delayed by a liquid-hydrogen
    fuel tank leak, threatening to scrub the mission. When that problem
    was finally whipped, stormy weather on the morning of the launch
    portended additional delays. With a long string of successful flights
    behind them, however, NASA officials decided to go ahead and commit
    Apollo 12 in the midst of a heavy downpour. As it climbed away from
    the launch pad, AS-507 was lost to sight almost immediately as it
    vanished into the low-hanging cloud layer. Within seconds, spectators
    on the ground were startled to see parallel streaks of lightning
    flash out of the cloud back to the launch pad. Inside the spacecraft,
    Conrad exclaimed, "I don't know what happened here. We had everything
    in the world drop out." Astronauts Pete Conrad, Richard Gordon, and
    Alan Bean, inside the spacecraft, had seen a brilliant flash of light
    inside the spacecraft, and instantaneously, red and yellow warning
    lights all over the command module panels lit up like an electronic
    Christmas tree. Fuel cells stopped working, circuits went dead, and
    the electrically operated gyroscopic platform went tumbling out of
    control. The spacecraft and rocket had experienced a massive power
    failure. Fortunately, the emergency lasted only seconds, as backup
    power systems took over and the instrument unit of the Saturn V
    launch vehicle kept the rocket operating. As the huge Saturn
    continued to climb, technicians on the ground helped the astronauts
    weed out their problems, resetting circuits and making sure that
    operating systems had not been harmed by the sudden, unexplained
    electrical phenomenon. Apollo 12 went on to complete a successful
    mission, and NASA scientists explained later that Apollo had created
    its own lightning. During the rocket's passage through the rain
    clouds, static electricity built up during
    [<A NAME="375"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">375</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] its ascent through the cloud cover had suddenly
    discharged and knocked out the spacecraft's electrical systems in the
    process.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Apollo 12 mission survived the lightning
    charge for a number of reasons, but one significant factor was
    related to the ingrained conservatism at Huntsville in designing the
    rocket booster engines. During one early phase in planning the
    Apollo-Saturn vehicle, there had been considerable debate about
    designing spacecraft guidance and control systems to take charge of
    the entire launch vehicle, including the booster stages. Marshall had
    opposed the idea, arguing that the requirements of translunar
    guidance and control, lunar orbit control, lunar module rendezvous,
    and other jobs would be plenty for the spacecraft computer to handle.
    The peculiarities of the booster stages predicated quite dissimilar
    computer functions and schemes for guidance and control. Marshall
    finally won its case: the booster stages got their own guidance and
    control equipment, represented by the instrument unit. Besides, this
    approach provided redundancy, because the spacecraft got a separate
    system. An external umbilical connection between the command and
    service modules made the spacecraft guidance and control system
    vulnerable to the lighting charge. When the spacecraft gear was
    knocked out on Apollo 12, the booster guidance and control system, a
    separate piece of hardware, kept the vehicle operating and on course
    while the spacecraft electronics were reset and put back in
    operation. This vignette of Apollo-Saturn operational lore was a
    favorite of several MSFC managers.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Apollo 13 got off successfully on 11 April
    1970. Because Thomas K. Mattingly II had failed to develop immunity
    after exposure to German measles, there was a last-minute
    substitution in the three-man crew, with John L. Swigert replacing
    him as command module pilot, joining Fred W. Haise, Jr., as lunar
    module pilot, and James A Lovell, Jr., as commander. The launch
    vehicle created some consternation among the mission officials
    monitoring AS-508 in flight, because the center engine of the S-II
    stage cut off 132 seconds too early, and the remaining four J-2
    engines burned 34 seconds longer than predicted. This left the space
    vehicle with a lower velocity than planned. Therefore, the S-IVB had
    to burn nine seconds longer than predicted to achieve proper orbital
    insertion. This hiatus in the boost phase of the mission led to
    questions about adequate propellants remaining in the S-IVB for the
    translunar injection burn. Double- checked calculations indicated
    that there were adequate propellants, and the second S-IVB burn put
    Apollo 13 into trajectory toward the lunar surface. The remainder of
    the flight was normal until about 56 hours after liftoff, when
    Swigert tensely called back to Mission Control, "Hey, we've got a
    problem here." With sudden concern, ground controllers responded,
    "This is Houston, say again please." This time Lovell replied,
    "Houston, we've had a problem."</FONT></P>

    tank of the service [<A NAME="376"></A></FONT><B><FONT

    result, all fuel-cell power was lost, as well as other CSM failures,
    including dangerously low oxygen supplies. Astronauts and mission
    controllers quickly agreed to abort the mission and concentrate on
    getting the three-man crew safely back home. Apollo 13 went into a
    "lifeboat mode" with emergency measures to stabilize the spacecraft
    environment and stretch the consummable items for life support as far
    as possible. Using the descent engine of the lunar module after
    completing a lunar flyby, Apollo 13 went into a return trajectory at
    a faster rate. Happily, the tense six-day mission ended successfully
    on 17 April, with splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. In the aftermath
    of the near disastrous flight of Apollo 13, NASA convened a special
    Apollo 13 review board. Working in high gear, the board's painstaking
    research pinpointed the problem as a pair of defective thermostatic
    switches that permitted dangerously high heat levels in a heater tube
    assembly associated with the oxygen tank equipment. The board stated
    that combustion probably occurred as the result of a short circuit
    from faulty wiring, resulting in a combustion in the oxygen tank.
    Following release of the board's report, there was extensive redesign
    of the oxygen tank, wiring, and related materials with a high
    combustion probability. There was an impact on the launch of Apollo
    14, which was slipped to 31 January 1971.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    the moon. The countdown and launch of AS-509 proceeded according to
    the book, with the only delay caused by high overcast clouds and rain
    that postponed the ignition by 40 minutes and 3 seconds. Failure of a
    multiplexer in the instrument unit meant that some information on the
    condition of the vehicle during flight was lost, and there were some
    minor problems during the docking maneuver in orbit. Aside from that,

    AS-512, performed without a hitch. The payload, however, was
    continuously climbing. These last three launches included the lunar
    rover vehicle, which added almost 225 kilograms to the payload of the
    Saturn V. The rover turned out to be extremely significant,
    permitting astronauts to extend greatly the range of surface
    explorations and increasing their stay time.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> The uprated engines of the Saturn V, which permitted
    it to boost this additional weight into orbit, turned out to be a
    function of thoughtful long-range planning by NASA engineers. In the
    evolution of rocket vehicles, the actual payload requirements almost
    always turned out to be greater than originally planned. As a result
    of bitter experience, engine designers kept in mind the likelihood
    that their creations would have to be uprated from time to time. In
    addition to this consideration, engine designers normally
    incorporated a certain degree of margin in setting up the
    specifications for engine development. If the specifications called
    for an engine of 4.5 [<A NAME="377"></A></FONT><B><FONT

    million pounds) thrust, it might be designed for 5.3 million newtons
    (1.2 million pounds) thrust to be sure that the original
    specification line was met. With operational experience, it was then
    possible to uprate the engine by relatively minor changes-improving
    the turbopump and the tubing (to improve flow rates), adjusting the
    injector for better mixing (to get a higher percentage of the fuel
    burned and increase the specific impulse)-these all were contributing
    factors to the success of uprating the engines of the Saturn V
    vehicle. In this way, the Saturn V was able to absorb not only the
    increasing weight of the command and service modules early in the
    program, but the added weight of scientific equipment and other
    paraphernalia such as the rover in the later stages of the
    Apollo-Saturn program.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Saturn I and Saturn IB missions had been
    intended to clear the way for Saturn V launch vehicles. Normally, the
    worst difficulties would have shown up in the R&amp;D flights of the
    former. Instead, one of the most baffling periods came early in the
    Saturn V flight series.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Saturn V development began auspiciously, with
    the calculated gamble on AS-501's "all-up" launch. The mission
    garnered precious time and raised confidence in the reliability of
    Saturn stages. The time and reliability factors seemed to slip away,
    however, with the perplexing flight of AS-502 and slipping schedules
    for the lunar module to be flown on AS-503. Recovering quickly, NASA
    and contractor personnel kept the momentum of Apollo-Saturn through
    diligent sleuthing to resolve the problems uncovered in AS-502 and

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There were two more Saturn V launches,
    wringing out the last details of mission hardware, before AS-506 took
    a crew to the lunar surface and back. Apollo 11 was a textbook
    flight, carried out in an unprecedented public exposure of worldwide
    dimensions. From beginning to end, it was a spectacularly successful
    mission, a historic odyssey in the annals of human exploration. The
    remaining six missions in the Apollo program were completed with no
    major difficulties stemming from the launch vehicles. In retrospect,
    the conservative design inherent in the Saturn launch vehicles paid
    off. Saturn V not only carried a spacecraft and lunar module whose
    weight had spiraled upward from original guidelines, but accommodated
    additional equipment such as the lunar rover. The added payload
    capability of the Saturn V also permitted delivery of more scientific
    gear to the moon, enhancing the scientific results of the
    Apollo-Saturn missions.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
