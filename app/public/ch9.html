    multifarious elements of the Saturn program entailed new tasks and
    concepts beyond the scope of any previous rocket program. As
    explained in chapter 9, MSFC's management was a dynamic process.
    Although rooted in the experience of the von Braun team, dating back
    to the 1930s, Saturn management responded to internal stimuli as well
    as external influences, including the prime contractors, NASA
    Headquarters, and other sources.</FONT></P>

    look back over a career in which he played a key role as a leader in
    rocket research, Wernher von Braun noted two significant factors of
    success. First, the group of German rocket experts, known as the von
    Braun team at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), had been a
    "fluid, living organization," shaped by and responding to external
    forces. Second, in three decades of consistent activity at the
    forefront of rocket development, an activity conducted with a
    "singleness of purpose, we have had only one long-range objective:
    the continuous evolution of space flight," von Braun emphasized.
    "Ever since the days of the young Rakentenflugplatz Reinickendorf in
    the outskirts of Berlin in 1930, we have been obsessed by a
    passionate desire to make this dream come true." Despite the changes
    over the years in personnel, in geography, in nationality, and in
    bureaucracies, von Braun continued, "many of our methods have
    remained unchanged."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    stage, or instrument unit, evolved without numerous-and
    continuous-problems. The persistence of various snarls is easily
    perceived by dipping at random in von Braun's "Weekly Notes" or
    "Daily Journal" from 1961 through 1970. Predicaments occurred
    everywhere and every day. Although complications in the Saturn
    program lingered, it is apparent that the most annoying problems
    tapered off during 1966. With increasing frequency, entries in the
    "Weekly Notes" and "Daily Journal" reported tests "successfully
    accomplished," results "well below red line," and hardware with
    "component qualification complete."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As Director of the new Marshall Space Flight
    Center in 1960, von Braun faced some immediate managerial challenges.
    The core of the staff had come from ABMA's Development Operations
    Division, which he had directed for the Army. But that division had
    been a research and development group depending on other ABMA offices
    for ancillary support and administrative services. After the transfer
    to NASA, the MSFC director had to develop an administrative as well
    as technical staff, in addition to providing procurement contracting,
    facilities engineering, and other support services. The von Braun
    team not only found itself in a civilian organization for the first
    time, but also the style of operations had changed. There were new
    responsibilities for numerous projects, as opposed to the ABMA
    experience of dealing with only one prime project at a
    time.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    under the MSFC organization, management retained a distinctive
    in-house capability-what von Braun liked to call the "dirty hands"

    Huntsville facility. Managers and engineers were never very far from

    key element in the success of MSFC's management of the Saturn
    program.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Technical competence was more than a catchword
    at Marshall; it was a way of life. As Director, von Braun somehow
    succeeded in keeping up with the paper work and budget reviews
    involving NASA and his own center, and at the same time, he kept an
    eye on minute technical details of the Saturn program. In 1967, for
    example, when von Braun received a weekly note on propulsion systems,
    he noticed that inlet pressures for the S-II center engine had been
    simulated at 1900 grams per square centimeter (27.0 pounds per square
    inch adiabatic) during J-2 engine tests. In the margin, von Braun
    jotted a note for one of the project engineers: "If I remember
    correctly, that would enable us to lower the LH</FONT><SUB><FONT

    doing?"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.4">4</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Throughout his tenure as Marshall's director,
    von Braun required such "Weekly Notes" from the laboratory chiefs and
    program managers, as well as from other personnel on an ad hoc basis
    when a problem was brewing. He was adamant about the length of these
    Weekly Notes, warning "notes exceeding one page will be returned for
    condensation." As the notes crossed von Braun's desk, he emphasized
    various points with check marks and underlined phrases and scribbled
    assorted messages in the margins: a compliment; a request for
    information; dismay; encouragement; and miscellaneous instructions.
    Reproduced copies went back to the originator with marginalia intact.
    Although curt and to the point, the replies were invariably personal,
    and occasionally tinged with humor. Informed of a possible strike by
    the janitorial contractor, von Braun responded, "Get me a broom! I'll
    sweep my own office."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.5">5</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the innumerable meetings attended by von
    Braun as chairman or participant, he displayed a remarkable ability
    to distill complex technical issues into terms that other
    participants could understand. Matt Urlaub, S-IC Program Manager,
    recalled technical presentations "that lost me in the first five
    (minutes)." After listening, von Braun would sum up the presentation
    in language clear to everyone. Yet von Braun consciously avoided
    dominating such sessions and attempted to bring out all opinions.
    These techniques contributed to genuine "team spirit." Konrad
    Dannenberg, a key manager and associate of von Braun since the days
    at Peenemuende, stressed the point: "You have to get all the people
    involved. Von Braun has a real good flair for that," he said.
    "Everyone, when he has a meeting with him, feels like the second most
    important man... and boy that really gives you a team spirit.
    Everyone is willing to do his best." Von Braun employed this trait
    effectively during tours of Marshall laboratories and contractor
    plants. He met with senior executives, but he also took a personal
    interest in what was happening on the
    [<A NAME="264"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">264</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] shop floor-the problems, the progress, and the tools.
    Von Braun talked just as easily with the "top brass" as with the
    "tin-benders." These tours had great significance in improving
    morale, and von Braun made periodic tours intentionally. The tours
    were helpful to him too, in sensing the pace of the program as well
    as the nature of difficulties as they developed.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.6">6</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This concern for technical aspects was a
    hallmark of Marshall planning, and von Braun personified it. In the
    earliest phase of Saturn design at ABMA, Frank Williams, an ABMA
    veteran, remembered von Braun's consistently close involvement. "It
    was just a ball working," Williams said, "having him [von Braun] come
    down and literally pore over the drawing boards with you, and look at
    the performance and check the engineering work." Williams went on to
    say that when the Saturn V design was being established, von Braun
    was in the forefront, immersing himself in the whole vehicle:
    structures, systems, and missions.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.7">7</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> This is not to say that only the Director and a small
    handful of top aides did the conceptual work and forced it through.
    One of the reasons for the Saturn success, Dannenberg emphasized, was
    "because a lot of real good down-to-earth planning was done at the
    beginning." Von Braun solicited advice and suggestions from workers
    in the shops, taking into account the realities of fabrication and
    manufacture as the design evolved. In this way, Dannenberg explained,
    von Braun avoided the pitfalls of having top-level managers making
    critical decisions among themselves and making assumptions about
    production that might not approach reality.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These tenets, among others, guided von Braun
    and his staff at Huntsville. Many other issues of organization,
    administration, and accountability had to be solved. The Saturn
    program was large, expensive, and involved complex contracts.
    According to one source, von Braun remarked that when he came into
    NASA, he knew how to go to the moon, but he did not know what a
    billion dollars was.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Eberhard Rees, who succeeded von Braun as
    MSFC's Director in 1970, said that when the Apollo-Saturn program was
    inaugurated in the early 1960s, the adolescent NASA organization had
    no comprehensive management apparatus; the management system
    developed "after some painful experiences" during the early
    development period. The management organization for the overall NASA
    program, as well as for MSFC, was not set up in a flash of insight,
    to remain unchanged for the duration of the program. Rather, as the
    program gained momentum and the configuration of the launch vehicles
    began to evolve, management [<A NAME="265"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">265</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] organization and
    tools also evolved, changing the programs over the years. As Rees
    observed, one of the axioms in the evolution of a large development
    project was that no static system of management would
    suffice.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.10">10</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During January 1960, when affiliated with
    ABMA, von Braun and his staff began to set up a management plan that
    would meet the approval of NASA Headquarters. The laboratories would
    continue to report directly to von Braun, and a new organizational
    position for a project director of the Saturn vehicle system was
    proposed. Details of vehicle integration, planning for R&amp;D, and
    mission payloads were worked out through a separate Saturn
    coordination board, chaired by von Braun. The arrangement was rather
    unwieldy, and was never completely implemented. However, the
    correspondence from Huntsville to Washington requesting approval
    reveals the strong influence of NASA Headquarters in early Saturn
    planning, including details of contractor selection. The early
    influence of the laboratories and their chiefs is also evident in the
    membership of the "working groups" that made up the Saturn
    coordination board.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.11">11</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The management organization for the early
    period of the Saturn program, when the Saturn I was the only launch
    vehicle being developed, relied on the Saturn Systems Office (SSO).
    At the heart of SSO were three project offices: Vehicle Project
    Manager; the S-I Stage Project Manager; and the S-IV and S-V Stages
    Project Manager (the S-V was a small third stage that was ultimately
    dropped from the Saturn I configuration). The vehicle project manager
    cooperated with the stage managers in overall vehicle configuration
    and systems integration. The Saturn I first stage was produced and
    manufactured in-house by MSFC at Huntsville, and the production of
    the upper stages as well as the engines and the instrument unit
    involved management of several other contractors. The SSO was a
    comparatively small office; in the spring of 1963 it employed only
    154 people. Its operation was based primarily on the strength of
    other center administrative support offices and the work of the "line
    divisions." The line divisions were based on the nine technical
    divisions, or laboratories (each composed of several hundred people),
    carried over nearly intact from the ABMA days.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The laboratories themselves carried
    significant prestige within the center and benefited from very strong
    support from von Braun. In fact, most technical decisions were
    reached by consensus during the "board meetings" of von Braun and the
    laboratory chiefs in executive sessions. For the lower stages of the
    Saturn I vehicles, produced in-house, this arrangement proved
    workable; and it must be remembered that the laboratory chiefs had
    worked this way for years, first at Peenemuende and later at ABMA.
    Much of the work in SSO concerned funds and liaison with NASA
    Headquarters. This was conducted in a very informal manner, with SSO
    personnel frequently visiting Washington.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="266"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">266</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The growth of the
    Saturn program to include development of two new launch vehicles
    caused a reappraisal of the production and management organizations.
    The finalization of plans during 1962 for a two-stage Saturn IB (for
    Earth-orbital manned Apollo hardware tests) and the three-stage
    Saturn V (for the manned Apollo lunar landing missions) enlarged the
    scope of SSO and prompted the shift of MSFC into a more comprehensive
    management role. The change was underscored by von Braun in remarks
    to a management convention in 1962, when he observed that "our rocket
    team has become today more than ever a managerial group." The Saturn
    IB and Saturn V manufacturing programs were far beyond the in-house
    capability of MSFC and available government resources, so that
    large-scale contracts under MSFC management were required. The von
    Braun group had some experience in the practice of accomplishing
    tasks through contracts. Outside of Peenemuende, important research
    work involving the V-2 was done by German universities in aspects of
    propellants, trajectories, and propellant systems. German industry
    also contracted for research and development of guidance and control
    systems, as well as turbopump machinery. The von Braun team had
    developed managerial skills in working with American contractors who
    built the Redstone, Jupiter, and Pershing missiles. Because of the
    size of the Saturn program and the diversity of the major contractors
    and subcontractors from coast to coast, a different management
    organization was required. The task of developing and integrating two
    or three large, complex stages and an instrument unit into a single
    vehicle that would mate with the spacecraft and launch facility was
    compounded by the multidisciplinary problems of weight, size, and
    manrating. The complexity was further increased by budgetary
    constraints and tight schedules. In responding to these new demands
    on management, both MSFC and NASA Headquarters changed existing
    agency techniques, developed new ones, and remodified techniques in
    response to changing conditions.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.13">13</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The reorganization of SSO in 1962 combined the
    similar Saturn I and IB vehicles under the management of a single
    office, established the Saturn V Launch Office, and set up the
    Saturn-Apollo Systems Integration Office. The reorganization further
    incorporated a new emphasis on these "project offices," that were
    empowered to draw directly from the expertise of the technical
    divisions. Internally, the technical divisions of MSFC did not change
    much more under the new NASA organization and continued to report
    directly to von Braun. As before, divisions were not designated
    specifically to projects, but were organized by professional
    disciplines-electronics, mechanical engineering, flight mechanics,
    and so on. Each division director had the responsibility to maintain
    a high level of expertise in his organization, keeping up with work
    in industry and other government agencies and carrying on theoretical
    research. Von Braun reminded everyone, "The technical people [must]
    keep their</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="267"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">267</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] hands dirty and
    actively work on in-house projects selected specifically for the
    purpose of updating their knowledge and increasing their competence."
    These practices were necessary to enable MSFC to comall phases of
    development, production, and shop work. Von Braun emphasized that
    this policy was the best preparation for evaluating contractor
    standards and proposals. The goal was to achieve the best economics
    in overall work and to get the maximum results for taxpayer
    dollars.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.14">14</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Von Braun noted in a memo on the
    reorganization, "It is important to spell out the responsibilities of
    the project offices in contrast to those of the technical divisions."
    The project offices managed efforts involving more than one
    discipline and reported directly to von Braun. Because of the
    technical complexity and scope implicit in project management, each
    office required technical support in depth. "It gets this support,
    not by creating it within its own organization, but by calling upon
    the technical divisions," von Braun wrote. He left no doubt about the
    vigorous role of project managers in the future operations of MSFC:
    "Since the direction of the various projects assigned to our Center
    constitutes our primary mission, I would like to make certain that
    Division Directors fully understand and fulfill their
    responsibilities in support of the management of those
    projects."</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The 1962 MSFC reorganization reduced the
    premier position of the technical divisions, or laboratories, and
    marked a historic break in the evolution of the Peenemuende group. As
    Bill Sneed recalled, the change was "painful" for von Braun to make.
    In his three-page memorandum explaining the change and the reasons
    for it, von Braun urged personnel, especially his division heads, to
    accept gracefully their changed status. "In the past, such a paper
    was needless," he wrote, and went on to explain the requisite logic
    for the new management responsibility in the program and project
    offices. "By keeping these principles in mind, and maintaining the
    spirit of teamwork which has been our tradition, we can adjust to our
    new conditions and retain our past performance
    standards."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the momentum of the Apollo-Saturn program
    increased and the activities of NASA Headquarters proliferated in
    response to the manned lunar landing program and other programs, a
    major reorganization was planned to cope with all the expanding
    operations. The reorganization involved all the major centers taking
    part in the Apollo-Saturn program,</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> and the change at Marshall Space Flight Center set the
    style for its operations for the next six years, the major period of
    Saturn V development. The change at MSFC strongly reflected past
    organizational arrangements, but also increased the authority of
    certain segments of the managerial structure. In addition, the change
    established successful new working arrangements between NASA
    Headquarters and MSFC, as well as within MSFC's new organizational

    Operations (IO). Both of the new organizations possessed equal
    operational authority, and both reported directly to von Braun as
    Director of MSFC. Operations between the two organizations, however,
    were continuous, and certain elements on the Industrial Operations
    side had a direct continuous relationship with NASA
    Headquarters.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> The new director of R&amp;DO, Herman Weidner, was a
    long-time member of the von Braun team from the Peenemuende era-a man
    with whom the other von Braun team veterans could work. The new IO
    director, on the other hand, came from industry, and reflected IO's
    contractual and managerial functions. The first IO director was
    Robert Young, formerly of Aerojet General. He played an interim role
    for about a year, and was succeeded by General Edmund O'Connor, on
    leave from the Air Force.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    delighted von Braun. Young seemed to have the managerial talents and
    industrial know-how that management of the Saturn program
    demanded.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> For personal reasons, Young decided to go back to
    Aerojet, although some insiders at Huntsville thought that he found
    it somewhat difficult to adjust to Marshall's style of operations.
    Executives at Young's level still had to clear many decisions through
    NASA Headquarters, as well as through von Braun's office; managers
    coming into Marshall from private industry frequently found the
    additional bureaucratic layers to be irksome. Also these executives
    soon found that some subordinates at MSFC frequently disagreed with
    the boss, even in large meetings. To some executives, this
    bureaucratic democracy could be unsettling. In any case, the
    appearance of Edmund O'Connor reflected an interesting tendency to
    bring on board a number of Air Force officers with managerial
    credentials. Despite its Army heritage, MSFC seemed to favor Air
    Force personnel in several key positions. They not only had
    experience in the ways of government bureaucracy, but also had more
    experience in managing large, complex missile systems, compared to
    the Army's responsibilities for smaller, artillery-type
    rockets.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    NASA. Experienced in technical program management, these officers
    were especially versed in configuration, program control, and quality
    assurance. Marshall Space Flight Center received a dozen Air Force

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In essence, the R&amp;DO laboratories were
    direct descendants of the older technical divisions, and the
    Industrial Operations elements were modifications of the former
    Saturn Systems Office. At the heart of the Industrial Operations
    organization were the three program offices, established for the
    direct management of the industrial contractors who had
    responsibility for the Saturn launch vehicles: the Saturn I-IB
    Office, the Saturn V Office, and the Engines Office. The function of
    the new Engines Office was to shift responsibility for engine
    development and production from the laboratories to Industrial
    Operations, in keeping with the intent of the 1963 reorganization for
    better management control by means of program and project
    management.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Each program office was set up similar to the
    Industrial Operations organization, so that each program manager had
    a cluster of small, dual-purpose staff and functional offices in
    addition to the project offices for technical management. Some
    closely structural elements were combined. The Saturn V Program
    Office, for example, managed the S-IVB stage, used on both the Saturn
    IB and Saturn V. Similarly, because some engines were used in more
    than one stage or vehicle, direction of the engine program was more
    effectively guided from one responsible Engine Program Office.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Arthur Rudolph, head of the Saturn V Program
    Office, emphasized that the managers of the staff and functional
    offices were not simply staff but were equal to the project managers
    for each of the project offices under Rudolph's jurisdiction. The
    staff and functional offices had multiple roles because they
    supported not only the program manager but each of the project
    management offices, and they interacted with NASA Headquarters as
    well.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.23">23</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> The staff and functional office managers were known
    informally in NASA circles as the "GEM Boxes" after George E.
    Mueller, who headed the Office of Manned Space Flight.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Formal guidance and direction from
    Headquarters to the centers came down through the Associate
    Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to the center director, and to
    the program manager, but daily informal management was accomplished
    through the GEM Boxes, who provided a "mirror image" between
    Headquarters and the centers.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.24">24</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> The GEM Boxes in the centers, identical to those in
    Mueller's office in Washington, facilitated a daily, and free, flow
    of information in both directions. "Since like persons were talking
    at both ends," commented one long-time observer of the system,
    "confusion and misunderstanding with accompanying loss of time and
    funds were held to a minimum." The impetus for this aspect of the
    managerial apparatus primarily came from Mueller. During visits to
    MSFC, Mueller emphasized to von Braun that the laboratories
    (R&amp;DO) were going to have to adopt more of a support
    [<A NAME="271"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">271</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] role in the new program management structure, and
    that better communications with Headquarters through IO were urgently
    required. Mueller felt that the centers in general were too
    independent in their relationships with Headquarters and that lack of
    regular communications was a serious shortcoming. "So I put together
    this concept of a program office structure, geographically dispersed,
    but tied with a set of functional staff elements that had
    intra-communications between program offices that were below center
    level and below the program office level so as to get some depth of
    communications," Mueller said.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.25">25</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Following the 1963 reorganization, the new
    program office began to formulate a mode of operations. As head of
    the Saturn V Program Office, Arthur Rudolph called on considerable
    managerial expertise in project management of rocket vehicles dating
    back to the years at Peenemuende, and especially during the ABMA
    period when he served as project director for the Army's Redstone and
    Pershing programs. From 1961 through 1963, he had worked at NASA
    Headquarters, in the Systems Engineering Division of the Office of
    Manned Space Flight. He had watched the plans for the Saturn V evolve
    and was aware of such factors as schedules, funds, and performance
    requirements.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.26">26</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> He also had specific ideas of how his program was
    going to run and placed considerable emphasis on what he called
    program element plans. Rudolph's staff often chafed under the
    requirements to write up these rather specific documents, which
    detailed what each office was going to do and how it was going to be
    accomplished. Most of the skeptics finally came around, however. The
    program element plans forced people to think about the goals and
    mechanics of their respective operations and how their operations
    interacted with the operations of other offices. Even if the authors
    seldom referred to the documents, they proceeded with greater success
    because they were forced to analyze the procedures from the start of
    the project. "I think the major problem is that in a big program like
    the Saturn V you have many people involved and usually people want to
    go off on tangents," Rudolph explained. "And the biggest problem is
    really to get them all to sing from the same sheet of music, to put
    it in the simple fashion. That's the biggest
    problem."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.27">27</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> James T. Murphy, who acted as Rudolph's deputy manager
    of the management division, summarized the role of his chief: "In its
    simplest concept, a program manager, with a supporting staff, has
    been designated to coordinate the efforts of all Government and
    private industry groups in developing and producing the Saturn V
    launch vehicle."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A major instrument in establishing a
    managerial approach was the Saturn V program control system plan,
    originated by Rudolph's office in 1965, and known as Directive No. 9.
    The objective was to establish a "baseline definition," against which
    progress could be plotted, problems highlighted, corrective actions
    taken, and management kept informed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The interfaces to be controlled throughout the
    Saturn program, such as those between stages, between the payload and
    the vehicle, and between the vehicle and the launch facilities,
    seemed limitless. With contractors and three major NASA centers in
    the Apollo-Saturn program, the interface problems covered physical,
    functional, and procedural areas, and these problems often became
    intertwined. The necessary documentation included both drawings and
    written directives to establish basic responsibilities as well as the
    limits of responsibilities for the parties involved. Once
    established, such documentation could not be altered unless all
    parties came to agreement on terms.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The interface aspects were established at the
    beginning of the Saturn V program with collaboration of appropriate
    inter-center coordination panels, working groups within MSFC,
    contractor advice, and a strong input from the R&amp;DO laboratories
    at MSFC.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.30">30</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"> When a contractor originated an engineering change
    proposal against the current configuration, he knew in advance the
    impact on other equipment and organizations, since the interface
    documents were already drawn up. Contractors had the opportunity to
    coordinate possible changes ahead of time by notifying related
    personnel of the time of the change and its ramifications.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Difficulties often cropped up during the
    process of interfacing various stages of the launch vehicle,
    spacecraft, related equipment and systems, and the various centers.
    To maintain configuration control, a group of inter-center
    coordination panels was established to resolve the interface
    problems. Technical personnel were appointed from the centers and
    from other NASA agencies. The formal communications media between
    panel members involved the interface control documents. The documents
    were divided into two levels: level A documented technical interfaces
    between the centers and level B did the same for hardware supplied by
    the NASA contractors. If the change concerned a single stage and
    involved no other interfaces, then the proposal could go through a
    change board at the project level at MSFC. If the change affected the
    interface with hardware on a different stage, it had to go to the
    program level (level B). If the change affected the program of a
    different NASA center, it was necessary to go through the
    inter-center coordination panel [</FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">275</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] to reach a decision
    (level A). In situations where the panel could not reach a decision,
    an executive group, the Panel Review Board, supervised and
    adjudicated the issues as necessary. The Board was chaired by the
    Apollo Program Director at NASA Headquarters and channeled its
    decisions back through the appropriate centers and program
    offices.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.31">31</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within MSFC itself, there were a number of
    "working groups" that originated early in the Saturn program to cope
    with various development problems that had cropped up. These groups
    became the acknowledged elements to work on the various interface
    problems concerning Huntsville's work on the Saturn program. The
    working groups were originally created in 1960 by Oswald Lange, who
    at that time headed the Saturn Systems Office, "to make available the
    experience of MSFC and contractor representatives toward the solution
    of stage interface and system problems." The purpose of the groups
    was not to deemphasize the responsibilities of other MSFC
    organizations or those of the contractor, but to monitor special
    areas and make informed, incisive recommendations through appropriate
    channels. The number of such working groups varied from time to time,
    with each group chaired by a senior technical authority from one of
    the laboratories, and including representatives from the appropriate
    program offices. Group recommendations were channeled through the
    Program Office Configuration Control Boards.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">To gauge the status of the program and to
    assess its progress, hundreds of MSFC personnel engaged in various
    levels of daily, weekly, and monthly staff meetings. Although
    informal contact between Saturn V Program Office personnel and
    contractor personnel occurred daily, in addition to recurring visits
    to contractor plants, the most important formal meeting was the
    Contractor Quarterly Project Review beginning in late 1964. In these
    meetings, contractor and MSFC managers reviewed not only the
    technical status of the project, but also the management status. In
    the meantime, the Saturn V program manager's office customarily held
    various staff meetings with each of the project managers in
    Huntsville, and also conducted a more elaborate monthly Saturn V
    Program Review with all of the project offices involved. These
    sessions, begun early in 1965, kept the program manager fully
    informed and provided an additional forum to cope with related
    problems. Rudolph did not like frequent staff meetings. Instead he
    liked to have fewer meetings in which the programs were discussed and
    analyzed in depth, leaving the management burden in the interim
    primarily on the shoulders of his project offices. This meant that
    the monthly sessions were very long indeed, and one of the standard
    jokes in Rudolph's office involved bleary-eyed project managers, in
    the early morning hours, dropping notes out of office windows: "Help
    me-I'm in a Rudolph meeting!"</FONT></P>

    the Associate Administrator at NASA Headquarters each month, or as

    designated personnel accompanied the MSFC director and participated
    in analyzing problems and progress, while at the same time receiving
    Headquarters information on policy changes and various program
    directives. The format was usually concerned with four main

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition, two other top-level meetings were
    customary in the Saturn program, one within NASA management and one
    that included the contractors. OMSF conducted an annual Apollo-Saturn
    program review attended by NASA Administrator Webb and selected
    staff. The center directors attended, and formal presentations were
    made by designated senior executives from the centers. These annual
    reviews gave the Administrator a comprehensive and critical analysis
    of contractor and program performance over the past year, with
    projections for the year ahead. As required, George Mueller
    occasionally convened what he called the Apollo Executive Group. This
    group involved the chief executives of the contractors in the
    Apollo-Saturn program. They met at various major contractor sites for
    briefings and visited each of the major NASA centers. Mueller said
    that without the Apollo Executive Group, "we would not have been able
    to succeed-it was one of the things that made it possible to
    succeed." All of the chief executives became aware of the problems
    and possibilities, and felt involved in the program. The meetings
    also gave NASA and the centers "top level interest and

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Since the role of the RMO was to expedite
    decisions, a small cadre of specialists was "to assure that project
    management interests were advanced and that decisions were made and
    implemented within the designated scope of authority of the resident
    group." Guidelines supplied to the RMO allowed him to make certain
    on-the-spot decisions with the backing of his staff. These decisions
    included making commitments in behalf of other offices and/or
    functions of the center. "This resident element proved to be a most
    important link between government and contractor activities in the
    management of large programs." In MSFC's opinion, the process of
    management was accelerated as a result of this on-site authority, and
    provided a "dynamic interface" between MSFC and the

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Eberhard Rees admitted that the surveillance
    of contractor operations, as well as their management, was "somewhat
    sensitive from the point of view of the contractor." In many
    instances, contractors felt that [<A NAME="278"></A></FONT><B><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> The longing for more freedom of action was evidently a
    legacy of the experience that most Saturn contractors had previously
    had with Air Force contracts. Huntsville had great technical
    competence; at certain managerial levels of design and manufacturing,
    grumped one highly placed contractor executive, Marshall maintained a
    one-on-one surveillance. The Air Force, he said somewhat wistfully,
    was "not in your pants all the time."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> But Rees maintained that loose reins on the contractor
    had not always worked out well from the MSFC point of view.
    "Consequently," he said, "it became clear that close and continuous
    surveillance of the contractor operation was required on an almost
    day-to-day basis." The extent of the surveillance was proportional to
    the subtleties and problems of the program, its relative position in
    relation to the existing state of the art, and the extent of
    expertise possessed by MSFC. The contractor's reaction to this aspect
    of NASA monitoring was not favorable at first, but eventually this
    "penetration and monitoring" was perceived to be a mutual benefit
    characterized by the often repeated phrase, the "government-industry
    team." "Contractor penetration" was an important concept that
    ultimately involved the contractor's relationship with his own
    subcontractors.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One of the most interesting aspects of
    contractor penetration was the RMO approach. NASA could exert
    considerable influence on technical decisions that affected the
    managerial organization of the contractors. General Samuel C.
    Phillips, who directed the Apollo Program Office at NASA
    Headquarters, revealed this leverage during one of the program review
    sessions held at NASA Headquarters in 1964. He noted that various
    contractors had strengthened their organizations during the preceding
    year, "either on their own or due to appropriate influence by
    NASA."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.40">40</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Phillips's comment on the use of appropriate
    influence was an understatement, since MSFC could, and did, force
    contractors to change their modes of operation. In 1963, the
    development of the S-IVB was in its dual role as the second stage of
    the Saturn IB vehicle and as the third stage of the Saturn V. This
    duality posed something of a problem of interfacing for the S-IVB
    prime contractor, Douglas Aircraft Company. Discussing the S-IVB
    project during the 1964 program review, Lee James pointed out that
    MSFC management wanted to make sure that Douglas did "not see two
    faces at Marshall. It is important they see only one." As far as the
    contractor was concerned, the Saturn IB/S-IVB manager acted as deputy
    to the Saturn V/S-IVB stage manager, placing basic responsibility in
    the Saturn V Program Office.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During his presentation, James spoke on the
    subject of "Saturn I/IB Launch Vehicles and Related Facilities," in
    which he noted that management constituted a "major part of the
    problem." Moreover, he continued, "a major part of that problem was
    considered to be with Douglas." </FONT></P>

    set up a project-oriented organization, James explained, and the
    management structure in operation never worked very well in any case.
    The crux of the difficulty seemed to be the company's Sacramento Test
    Facility (SACTO), set up as a part of the engineering manufacturing
    divisions, with ties to both Santa Monica and Huntington Beach. As a
    result, James said, there was no place "to pull their organization
    together" to make sure programs like the battleship test and the
    all-systems test evolved smoothly and logically. Management at MSFC
    stepped in to remedy the situation. James put it bluntly: "We forced
    Douglas to reorganize Sacramento into a separate entity." As a
    result, SACTO reported directly to the upper echelons of Douglas
    management, and MSFC was involved in the reassignment of Douglas's
    Deputy Director of the Saturn Program to the new position of Director
    of Sacramento Test Operations, a further benefit to the
    reorganization. To enable MSFC to operate from a stronger posture at
    Douglas, the office of the Resident Manager was strengthened, and a
    new person was brought in for the job. James said that over 90
    applications for the position had been received, and he was pleased
    to report that "a very strong individual" had been chosen. In fact,
    the successful applicant was so eager to shoulder the
    responsibilities that he took a salary cut of $8500. "I think we have
    found just the man we are looking for in order to give us the
    strength on the spot that we need," James
    concluded.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The policy of contractor penetration did not
    imply relentless meddling in the internal affairs or organization of
    the company. Indeed, most of the pressure applied by MSFC seemed to
    occur early in the program. Monitoring continued, but on a lesser
    scale. The initial problems were peculiar to the complicated
    requirements of getting "cranked up" for a new program such as S-IVB
    battleship testing, where MSFC, Douglas, and Rocketdyne (the engine
    contractor) were all involved. MSFC formulated a "start team" that
    used personnel from all three organizations. This special group
    coordinated and channeled early activities, and proved to be a
    successful approach in the S-IVB program. As the, program gained
    momentum, the contractor assumed more responsibility. "We also
    recognized in the S-IVB program that Douglas is a major manufacturing
    organization and once they get rolling, they are a good
    organization," said James emphatically. "Our problem always is on the
    initial stages. We have made a major effort to concentrate on getting
    the first stage out the door, knowing we can trust a contractor like
    Douglas to follow on with the succeeding stages."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The technique of contractor penetration to
    maintain high visibility obviously generated some thorny issues in
    government-contractor relations. Nevertheless, MSFC felt that
    industry had a strong inclination to take control of the job and the
    funding and pursue the job with a minimum of government intervention.
    MSFC management believed this inclination allowed too much
    opportunity for slippage, unidentified
    [<A NAME="281"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">281</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] problems, and poor communications. Vigorous
    contractor penetration reduced these program difficulties; in the
    long run, the contractors seemed inclined to accept the penetration
    as a mutually useful aspect of completing a successful program. "The
    restiveness that stemmed from such close control was gradually
    dissipated very early in the Apollo program as the benefit accruing
    from the industry-government team approach was revealed," concluded
    Eberhard Rees.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Realizing the relationship between contractor
    motivation and success, the Saturn V Program Office implemented
    general NASA policy regarding contract incentives as a means of
    encouraging the contractor to perform at the highest possible level
    of endeavor. Most of the original contracts stipulated a
    cost-plus-fixed fee, useful in the early phases of a program when
    management had to deal with many unknown factors and close pricing
    was uncertain. After the R&amp;D phase was well in hand and the
    unknowns were worked out, it became possible to adapt incentive- or
    award-fee provisions in all Saturn contracts except the S-II stage
    contract. The S-II contract eventually had limited award-fee
    provisions for management performance. The contracts for the lunar
    roving vehicle and the instrument unit were cost-plus-incentive fee
    (CPIF) from their initiation. The remaining contracts were changed in
    1966 from cost-plus-fixed fee to cost-plus-incentive fee.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The incentive contracts were established in
    two portions: a comparatively modest base fee, and a segment of
    payments scaled to incentives. These scaled incentive fees were
    awarded in proportion to the contractor's success in meeting time
    schedules, cost allowances, and performance ranges. The incentive fee
    contract was judged to be most successful in cases involving hardware
    contracts where schedules, costs, and major milestones were fairly
    well established. The Saturn V Program Office considered the approach
    a successful alternative to fixed-fee contracts, because the
    incentive-fee contracts encouraged the contractor to meet commitments
    on hardware delivery and contributed to mission
    success.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within the Saturn V Program Office, as in
    other MSFC operations, management paid special attention to the areas
    of reliability and quality control. The project offices viewed
    reliability as a significant element of basic design technique, and
    continued relevant procedures for judging the design of subsystems,
    components, and parts, as well as the overall stage design. This
    approach included techniques to evaluate the necessity for
    redundancy, criticality of numbers, and failure mode and effects
    analysis. Management also pursued an exceedingly active qualification
    test program, exposing components and subsystems to simulated flight
    loads under environmental conditions. This test was a major
    [<A NAME="282"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">282</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] contributive factor to the success of the
    Apollo-Saturn program, although it was expensive. The hardware was
    costly, and rigorous testing of such a large portion of it meant that
    much of the hardware could not be used later as flight hardware. In
    some cases where funds were particularly tight, qualification tests
    were conducted at a reduced level, followed by intensive and
    exhaustive data analyses to extrapolate performance through various
    conditions of flight. The object was to be able to use such hardware
    on actual missions later on. In these instances, it was necessary to
    be careful not to overstress these future flight components, and to
    extrapolate data so as to avoid risks during the actual
    missions.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.46">46</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The problem of quality control was further
    affected by MSFC's reliance on the Department of Defense, which
    exercised quality control management in some of the contractor
    plants. In the mid- 1960s, MSFC made an effort to increase its own
    quality control programs, particularly in the inspection of incoming
    vendor surveillance. Douglas, for example, evolved its own approved
    parts list; parts not listed were unacceptable in design
    specifications submitted by prospective vendors. Basic guidelines for
    the list came from MSFC documents, buttressed by information from the
    military, industry sources, and Douglas's own experience, and were
    substantiated by operational and test data in the course of the
    program. The approved parts list included such items as bearings,
    fasteners, switches, relays, transformers, wires and cables,
    capacitors, resistors, semiconductors, and fluid fittings. Among the
    tangle of parts required to make a rocket work, the pipes and tubing
    with their respective connections were expected to operate under
    extreme and rapid temperature change, shocks, low pressure, and
    intense vibration. All parts had to be flight weight and have the
    imprimatur of the approved parts list.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#9.47">47</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Saturn V Program Office continued to
    monitor the activities of its own prime contractors, stepping in when
    necessary to advise changes. One such instance occurred in July 1964,
    when one of the welds of the S-IVB stage failed and the consequent
    rupture of the tankage caused the loss of the entire structural test
    stage. As a result of this incident, MSFC "caused Douglas to go into
    TIG welding with the higher heat input than the MIG welding that they
    were using in certain areas." MSFC technical personnel reported
    higher reliability after the change, and approved Douglas's revision
    of weld inspection procedures, which MSFC judged to have been
    somewhat weak.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In pursuing reliability and quality control,
    the project managers found that they had to exercise considerable
    diplomatic tact, making sure that the contractor had sufficient
    leeway to develop valid design concepts without overdoing it. "It is
    in the nature of experts that they become beguiled by intriguing
    technological problems," warned Eberhard Rees, and such beguilement
    could lead to excessive pursuit of reliability and performance. This
    situation was sometimes tolerable in industry, in the interest of
    better products for competition, but not in the space program.
    [<A NAME="283"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">283</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] It was necessary to be constantly on guard against
    losing simplicity-easy to do in the early stages of a program that
    was complex, large, and pressed by tight schedules. "Even when
    weighed in the balance against sacrifice of performance, design
    simplicity should be strongly favored," Rees recommended, because
    more components and higher performance often increased the prospects
    for failure. Rees noted that "Project management has here a rather
    complicated task of putting the brakes on these tendencies without
    discouraging development of new technology and with it of highly
    inventive people." Arthur Rudolph was adamant about this point, and
    put it even more succinctly: "Make it simple, make it simple, make it
    simple!"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the quest for high performance,
    reliability, and quality control, incentive contracts constituted
    only one of a number of blandishments. Several techniques were
    employed by MSFC, including cash awards and special recognition for
    quality control, cost reduction, and other activities. At MSFC, the
    Saturn V Program Office cooperated with the Manned Flight Awareness
    Office in a program to inform and remind all workers in the
    Apollo-Saturn program about the importance of their work and the need
    for individual efforts. By means of awards and recognition programs,
    the Manned Flight Awareness concept became an effective incentive
    technique. The prime contractors also conducted special incentive
    programs, in collaboration with the project managers and RMO
    personnel. North American's program was known as PRIDE (Personal
    Responsibility in Daily Effort), and Douglas had its "V.I.P."
    campaign (Value in Performance). MSFC's Manned Flight Awareness
    personnel and the contractors also participated in a program to make
    sure that vendors and subcontractors shipped critical spare hardware
    in special containers and boxes. These boxes were marked with
    stickers and placards imprinted with reminders to handle with
    particular care, because the hardware was important to the astronauts
    whose lives depended on the integrity of the
    hardware.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    Saturn V Program Office manager said, it was "essential that we had
    some way of making sure that we had pulled together all the facets of
    the program into an integrated program with good visibility. And

    developed in 1956 for the use of Rear Admiral William F. Raborn, Jr.,
    during the Polaris program. To get ideas for Raborn's Management
    Center room, his personnel visited the Air Force Ballistic Missile
    Division in Inglewood, California, and, interestingly, the ABMA
    operation in Huntsville. The Polaris center was designed to avoid the
    look of a boardroom and was filled with 90 chairs facing a large
    motion-picture and slide screen in the front, and numerous charts
    hung on the walls around the room. The idea was to provide maximum

    audio-visual aids, intended to reduce the reams of management reports
    being used to monitor the progress of the program. The company
    activated such a control room at its S-IC (the Saturn V first stage)
    manufacturing facility at Michoud, near New Orleans, Louisiana, in

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The PCC epitomized the managerial concepts of
    "management by exception" and "single threading." The technique of
    management by exception was based on the premise that the program
    manager should keep his number of contacts within manageable limits,
    and Arthur Rudolph relied heavily on his project managers to work
    with the contractors and solve various problems as they arose.
    "Within my Saturn V Program Office," Rudolph explained, "each project
    manager has wide latitude to exercise management actions just as long
    as these actions meet established technical performance requirements
    and schedule and budget constraints." Rudolph's control over the
    project managers went just far enough to ensure that performance,
    schedule, and budget guidelines were met, that interfaces were kept
    in repair, and that unintended redundancy was eliminated. "This
    policy of management by exception has enabled us to operate
    effectively and efficiently and has given my people the incentive to
    perform to their fullest capabilities," he said.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The PCC needed to develop a means of singling
    out special problems for more detailed analysis, including probable
    program impact, and to know exactly who was responsible for

    for various levels of detail. This approach permitted managers to
    identify the problem, begin action for resolution, and monitor

    Director's office at Headquarters, at each of the three Apollo-Saturn
    NASA centers (Kennedy, Marshall, and Houston), at each of the prime
    contractors' offices, and at Mississippi Test Facility. The network
    allowed top management and other personnel to keep up with a myriad
    of activities, including logistics, astronaut training, scientific
    projects, selection of lunar landing sites, the worldwide tracking
    network, mission planning, and the mission itself. Each had the

    information: open wall displays and projected visual aids. The open
    wall displays were used to portray information that was updated and
    changed on a cyclical, day-to-day, or new-problem basis. Most of the
    display charts were constructed so that they could be moved in and
    out of position on horizontal tracks. They were marked by coded
    symbols so the viewer could tell at a glance if a project was
    lagging, ahead of schedule, or on schedule. Both the project offices
    and the staff-functional offices submitted data and maintained
    liaison with PCC personnel throughout the preparation and use of the
    display charts, and the offices were responsible for having proper
    attendance in meetings where their display material was to be

    representative could not answer questions or supply additional
    information, the person to contact was immediately identifiable from
    the chart, and a quick phone call could make him-or the
    information-available during the meeting. Some charts concerned items
    being covered by what MSFC called the problem resolution system. The
    data indicated the criticality of the problem, the specific hardware
    or operation involved, the originator of the data, the identity of

    Reporting Technique). PERT was a sophisticated and complex
    computerized system, with inputs beginning, literally, at the tool
    bench. Technicians on the floors of contractor plants around the
    country monitored the progress of nearly all the hardware items and
    translated the work into computer cards and tapes. Data for costs and
    schedules were also entered into the system. The PERT network was
    broken down into 800 major entities, and summarized 90 000 key events
    taking place around the country. PERT helped provide

    management regarded PERT as a very successful effort. At a NASA
    Management Advisory Committee conference in 1964, von Braun said that
    PERT was the best source of information available on the status of
    hardware programs. The PERT network did not catch everything; for
    example, a parts problem on Boeing's S-IC-T (test stage) had been
    missed. Still, MSFC managers in 1973 recalled PERT as one of the most
    useful management systems, although the PERT network was phased out
    about the time of the launch of the first Saturn vehicle (AS-501) in
    the winter of 1967. One reason was that PERT was tremendously
    expensive. A large number of people within NASA and from the
    contractor's special computer programs were needed to make the
    network perform adequately. "It has some use as a preliminary
    planning tool," said R. G. Smith, a Rudolph successor, "but when tens
    of thousands of events per stage are used, it is difficult to
    analyze, usually lagging in real time usefulness, and subject to
    manipulation to avoid exposure of real problems."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    activities, the PCC was linked to KSC and Houston by closed-circuit
    television. Although conferences in the PCC were not televised by
    closed circuit (because of space limitations and technical problems),
    the communications arrangement permitted discussions in the PCC to be
    heard instantaneously at NASA Headquarters and other centers. The
    ceiling of the PCC room was studded with extrasensitive microphones,
    so that anyone at the conference table in Huntsville could interject
    a comment or respond without leaving his seat, and nobody had to wait
    until a speaker somewhere else had finished. When a speaker in
    Huntsville was making a presentation, conferees in Houston or Cape
    Kennedy could freely respond. In addition, conferees visually
    followed the presentation at other locations by means of viewgraphs
    supplied beforehand by the speaker. The viewgraphs were transmitted
    by Long Distance Xerox (LDX) system on a leased telephone circuit.
    Using standard typewriter-size sheets, the LDX line transmitted
    high-fidelity copies at the rate of about two copies per minute.
    After receipt at the other end, personnel used them to reproduce the
    numbered viewgraphs, shown in sequence as requested by the speaker.
    The fast response of the LDX system permitted up-to-the-minute

    program, managers needed to be especially flexible because many
    "unpredictable difficulties" as well as many "unanticipated
    opportunities" would crop up. Many traditional management concepts
    were not applicable because the large-scale R&amp;D endeavor was so
    dynamic. Managers needed to have a sound foundation in basic
    management principles, but also needed to be able to work in an
    environment where the lines of communication crisscrossed and moved
    in unusual directions, and where the job was not always exactly
    defined in the beginning. The successful manager had to do more than
    understand the organizational framework backward and forward. He had
    to grasp the total dimensions of the effort and define his role in
    the task. In this context, successful aerospace managers availed
    themselves of existing fundamentals of management, whatever their
    source of origin, and raised them to a higher degree of refinement in

    style was a blend of the decades of experience of the original von
    Braun team in Germany and management concepts from the Army, Navy,
    Air Force, other government agencies, and private industry. As the
    early SSO began to elaborate its relationships with prime
    contractors, Air Force concepts of configuration management became
    more conspicuous. During the evolution of the Saturn program at MSFC,
    the Army's arsenal concept was inherent in the R&amp;DO arrangement,
    although its premier role was altered as a result of 1963
    reorganization. Both the Army and the Air Force contributed key
    managers.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force influence was pervasive, from
    the Headquarters level on down. George Mueller, Associate
    Administrator for Manned Space Flight, came from private industry
    (Space Technology Laboratories), but he had worked with several Air
    Force missile programs, including Atlas, Thor, Titan, and Minuteman.
    His deputy for the Apollo-Saturn program, Brigadier General Samuel C.
    Phillips (USAF), brought skills in configuration management and
    logistics management that had been acquired during the Minuteman
    effort. At MSFC, Robert Young, the first IO director, had executive
    experience with an industrial contractor (Aerojet) that also had been
    involved in Air Force missile programs. Young was succeeded by
    General Edmund F. O'Connor (USAF). The influx of other Air Force
    officers in 1964 has already been noted. On the other hand, numerous
    Army officers left ABMA to join MSFC, including Lee James, who served
    at one time as the Saturn I-IB Program Manager, worked at NASA
    Headquarters, and later was head of the IO division. James replaced
    General O'Connor, who had returned to the Air Force. From NASA
    Headquarters, Mueller's GEM Boxes constituted a significant
    managerial technique in the Apollo-Saturn program, and MSFC
    elaborated upon its own concepts of working groups, management
    matrices, and (borrowing a bit from the Polaris program) the Program
    Control Center.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    R&amp;DO provides technical knowledge in depth to solve the technical
    problems, but at the same time carefully avoiding any interference
    with contract management. The stage manager is the sole contact with
    the contractor." Reading the minutes of the meeting a few days later,
    one of the top managers in the Saturn V Program Office expressed his
    frustrations in an astringent comment scribbled in the margin:
    "Wouldn't it be good if this were so! Top mgt. needs to say so in a

    harassment. A stage manager might call up a laboratory chief in
    R&amp;DO and complain about the lack of activity or lack of
    cooperation from the counterpart personnel in the laboratories. Other
    methods included pointed reminders about directives from the program
    manager's office, a claim to be acting at the behest of the program

    Saturn V Program Office; other program offices tended to allow the
    hardware managers greater authority. Rudolph's arrangement was deemed

    During a visit to MSFC in 1965, not long after the activation of the
    PCC, Webb was given a thorough briefing on the facility by Rudolph
    and Bill Sneed, who was head of the Program Control Office at the
    time. Following the briefing, Webb addressed a select group of MSFC
    personnel, and was obviously enthusiastic about the PCC concept. "I

    executives from government and American and foreign industry trouped
    through the PCC. The Saturn V Program Office also received inquiries
    by telephone and letter from a wide spectrum of sources, including
    the famed design group of Raymond Loewy and Associates. A former
    member of the Polaris management team once visited the PCC and came

    government- industry partnership was notably successful, and the
    in-house capability at MSFC was highly effective in monitoring
    contractor performance and providing backup skills and facilities.
