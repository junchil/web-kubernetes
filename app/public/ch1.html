    blurs many details. Part One is intended to bring back into focus
    some of the facts, circumstances, and background of space
    exploration. The opening section of chapter 1 briefly recapitulates
    the flight of Apollo 11-the first lunar landing mission-and provides
    the opportunity to introduce some of the hardware and nomenclature of
    the Apollo-Saturn program. A historical overview of rockertry,
    including the main threads of Saturn's origins' provides a background
    for the scope and boldness of Apollo 11 and the Saturn adventure in
    the chapters that follow.</FONT></P>

    May 1969. In slow sequence, the 142-meter-high doors ponderously
    opened, retracting upward like a vertical accordion, revealing the
    launch vehicle inside the huge gray structure known as the Vehicle
    Assembly Building. As the folding doors moved higher, the bright
    morning sun highlighted the whiteness of the three-stage launch
    vehicle with its scarlet lettering and black markings. Most of the
    American public, and the world, knew the towering 111-meter rocket as
    the Saturn V or the Apollo 11. To the men and women who buslt it, it
    was known better by its official designation: AS-506. Whatever its
    name, everyone knew its destiny. This rocket was going to be the
    first to land men on the moon.</FONT></P>

    FACE="Geneva">4</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The intricacies of a
    successful lunar mission dictated a multiphased operation, and the
    Saturn V was a multistage rocket. Early plans for the moon rocket
    included proposals for a comparatively simple "one-shot" vehicle in
    the form of a single- stage rocket. For all the attraction of the
    basic simplicity of a single-stage rocket as compared with a
    multistage vehicle, designers finally discarded it. The single-stage
    concept would have required a rocket of great girth and structural
    strength to carry all the required propellants. As a single-stage
    vehicle climbed into space, a considerable weight penalty developed
    because all the weight of the empty tankage had to be carried along.
    This weight penalty severely limited the size of the payload- in this
    case, a manned spacecraft. The multistage design allowed the first
    stage, with its big booster engines, to drop off once its rocket
    propellants were depleted. The second stage was more efficient
    because it had relatively less weight to push further into the
    planned trajectory, and it benefited from the accelerative forces
    imparted to it by the first stage. By the same token, the third stage
    had an even lighter weight and an even higher acceleration. In
    addition, the multistage approach permitted the use of special
    high-energy fuels in the upper stages. These considerations played a
    large role in the development of the Saturn V as a three-stage launch
    vehicle.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For the Apollo 11 mission, components of the
    Saturn V launch vehicle and the Apollo spacecraft had arrived in
    segments at Cape Kennedy. Whether they reached their destination by
    ship, barge, plane, or truck, they were all consigned for delivery to
    the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). Inside, they were stacked
    together to make up the moon rocket. The VAB was the heart of NASA's
    mobile launch concept, a radical departure from earlier tradition in
    rocket launching. Previous custom was to "stack" (assemble) the
    rocket at the launch pad itself, with minimal protection from the
    elements afforded by a comparatively makeshift structure thrown up
    around the rocket and its launching tower.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This approach completely tied up the launch
    pad during the careful stacking procedures and lengthy checkout. The
    size and complexity of the Saturn V dictated a change in tactics.
    NASA was planning a heavy schedule of Saturn launches and simply
    could not accept the consequent tie-up of launch sites. In a bold new
    approach, NASA implemented the mobile launch concept, which entailed
    the erection and checkout of several of the three-stage vehicles and
    spacecraft inside one gargantuan building, the VAB, with equipment to
    move the readied vehicles to a nearby launch site. At KSC's Launch
    Complex 39, a small army of engineers and technicians received
    components of the Saturn V, checked them out, assembled the complete
    vehicle, and conducted the launch. The facilities of the sprawling
    complex included the VAB, the mobile launcher, the
    crawler-transporter, the crawlerway to the launch pad, the mobile
    service structure, and the launch pad itself.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    Saturn V, the S-IC, employed a cluster of five F-1 engines of 6 672
    000 newtons (1 500 000 pounds) of thrust each, for a total of 33 360
    000 newtons (7 500 000 pounds) of thrust. The first-stage propellant
    tanks contained 767 cubic meters (203 000 gallons) of RP-1 fuel (a
    kerosene-type fuel) and 1251 cubic meters (331 000 gallons) of
    oxidizer (liquid oxygen, or LOX). The S-IC consumed these propellants
    in a fiery holocaust lasting only 2.5 minutes, by which time the
    Saturn V was boosted to a speed of about 9700 kilometers per hour at
    the cutoff altitude of around 61 kilometers. The spent first stage
    fell away, to fall into the sea, and the S-II second stage took over.
    Like the first stage, the S-II also mounted a cluster of five
    engines, but these were the 1 112 000 newtons (250 000 pounds) of
    thrust J-2 type, burning liquid hydrogen as fuel, and using liquid
    oxygen as the oxidizer. In the course of its six-minute "burn," the
    second stage propelled the Saturn V to an altitude of 184 kilometers,
    accelerating to a speed of 24 620 kilometers per hour. At this point,
    the Saturn vehicle had nearly reached the speed and altitude for
    Earth orbit. After the second stage dropped away, following its
    precursor into the ocean, the S-IVB third stage then hurtled the 113
    400-kilogram payload into a 190-kilometer orbit, using its single J-2
    engine for a burn of 2.75 minutes. In this final part of the orbital
    mission sequence, the remainder of the launch vehicle and its payload
    barreled into orbit at a speed of 28 200 kilometers per hour.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The S-1VB did not deplete its fuel during the
    third-stage burn, because the mission called for the S-1VB to
    reignite, firing the spacecraft out of Earth orbit and into the
    translunar trajectory to the moon. During the parking orbit (one to
    three circuits of the Earth), Astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and
    Collins completed a final check of the third stage and the
    spacecraft, while ground technicians analyzed telemetry and other
    data before making the decision to restart the J-2 for the translunar
    trajectory burn. No problems showed up to suggest the possibility of
    terminating the flight, so mission personnel waited for the precise
    moment in Earth orbit for the last five-minute operation of the
    Saturn V launch vehicle. Two hours and 44 minutes after liftoff, over
    the southern Pacific, the S-IVB ignited and accelerated the
    spacecraft to 39 400 kilometers per hour-enough to carry the
    spacecraft out of Earth orbit and place it in a trajectory bound for
    the moon. The third stage was not immediately separated from the rest
    of the spacecraft. First, the command and service module (CSM)
    separated from the lunar module adapter, reversed itself and
    performed a docking maneuver to pull the lunar module away from the
    now spent third stage and the instrument unit. This transposition and
    docking maneuver signaled the end of the Saturn V launch vehicle's
    useful life.</FONT></P>

    minimize the chances of the two elements colliding with each other.
    The spacecraft performed a three-second burn with its service it
    propulsion system to impart a velocity increase of six meters per
    second. This procedure not only widened the distance between the two,
    but also put the spacecraft and the three-man crew into a free-return
    trajectory, which used the lunar gravitational field to aid in a
    return to Earth in case the lunar landing had to be aborted. NASA
    also wanted to avoid the chances of the S-IVB impacting into the
    lunar surface in the vicinity of the astronauts' landing zone, so an
    automated sequence triggered a dump of residual propellants in the
    S-IV to realign the third stage's trajectory in such a way that the
    moon's gravitational field increased the S-IVB's velocity in a
    different direction. This "slingshot" maneuver was effective enough

    concepts and plans and work by a host of people who had continuously
    worked toward the goal of manned lunar exploration. The rocket

    military, whaling, and life-saving rockets from antiquity through
    World War I: they were powder-burning, or "solid," rockets. A solid
    rocket, although simple, had several shortcomings. The rate of thrust
    after ignition of the rocket could not be controlled; there was no
    guidance after the launch; the powder technology at the turn of the
    century seemed to dictate a missile with an optimum weight of about
    68 kilograms (most were in the 14-23-kilogram category); and the
    range rarely exceeded 2700 meters. Advances in artillery in the late
    19th century had already displaced the rocket as an effective

    exploration had to consider other sources for fuel, and there were
    still the problems of guidance, as well as the problem of human
    survival in the space environment.</FONT></P>

    in the new era of rocket technology were Konstantin Tsiolkovsky
    (1857-1935), Robert H. Goddard (1882-1945), and Hermann Oberth (1894-
    ). They were imaginative men who drew their theories and experiments
    from the growing bank of science and technology that had developed
    around the turn of the century. For one thing, the successful
    liquefaction of gases meant that sufficient quantities of fuel and
    oxidizer could be carried aboard a rocket for space missions.
    Research into heat physics helped lay the foundations for better
    engine designs, and advances in metallurgy stimulated new standards
    for tanks, plumbing, and machining to withstand high pressures, heat,
    and the super-cold temperatures of liquefied gases. Progress in
    mathematics, navigational theory, and control mechanisms made
    successful guidance systems possible.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although Tsiolkovsky did not construct any
    working rockets, his numerous essays and books helped point the way
    to practical and successful space travel. Tsiolkovsky spent most of
    his life as an obscure mathematics teacher in the Russian provinces,
    but he made some pioneering studies in liquid chemical rocket
    concepts and recommended liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen as the
    optimum propellants. In the 1920s, Tsiolkovsky analyzed and
    mathematically formulated the technique for staged vehicles to reach
    escape velocities from Earth. In contrast to the theoretical work of
    Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard made basic contributions to rocketry in
    flight hardware. Following graduation from Worcester Polytechnic
    Institute, Goddard completed graduate work at Clark University in
    1911 and became a member of the faculty there. In the l920s, he
    continued earlier experiments with liquid-fueled vehicles and is
    credited with the first flight of a liquid-propellant rocket on 16
    March 1926. With private support, Goddard was able to pursue
    development of larger rockets; he and a small crew of technicians
    established a test site in a remote area of the Southwest not far
    from Roswell, New Mexico. From 1930 to 1941, Goddard made substantial
    progress in the development of progressively larger rockets, which
    attained altitudes of 2300 meters, and refined his equipment for
    guidance and control, his techniques of welding, and his insulation,
    pumps, and other associated equipment. In many respects, Goddard laid
    the essential foundations of practical rocket technology, including
    his research paper entitled "A Method of Attaining Extreme Altitude"
    (published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1919)-a primer in
    theory, calculations, and methods-and his numerous patents that
    comprised a broad catalog of functional rocket hardware. In spite of
    the basic contributions of Tsiolkovsky in theory, and of Goddard in
    workable hardware, the work of both men went largely unheralded for
    years. Tsiolkovsky's work remained submerged by the political
    conditions in Russia and the low priority given to rocket research
    prior to World War II. Goddard preferred to work quietly, absorbed in
    the immediate problems of [<A NAME="9"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">9</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] hardware development
    and wary of the extreme sensationalism the public seemed to attach to
    suggestions of rocketry and space travel.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although the work of Hermann Oberth was
    original in many respects, he was also significant as advocate and
    catalyst because he published widely and was active in popularizing
    the concepts of space travel and rocketry. Born in Transylvania of
    German parentage, Oberth later became a German citizen. He became
    interested in space through the fictional works of H.G. Wells and
    Jules Verne and left medical school to take up a teaching post where
    he could pursue his study and experimenting in rocketry. Oberth's
    work was independent of Tsiolkovsky's, and he heard of Goddard's
    brief paper of 1919 just as his own book, The Rocket into Planetary
    Space, was going to press in 1923. The Rocket into Planetary Space
    was read widely, translated into English, and was the precursor of
    many other books, articles, and lectures by the energetic author.
    Oberth analyzed the problems of rocket technology as well as the
    physiological problems of space travel, and his writings encouraged
    many other enthusiasts and researchers. In 1928, Oberth and others
    were consultants for a German film about space travel called The Girl
    in the Moon. The script included the now-famous reverse countdown
    before ignition and liftoff. As part of the publicity for the movie,
    Oberth and his staff planned to build a small rocket and launch it.
    The rocket was only static-fired and never launched, but the
    experience was a stimulating one for the work crew, including an
    18-year-old student named Wernher von Braun.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the ensuing years, Oberth continued to
    teach while writing and lecturing on space flight, and he served as
    president of the Verein fur Raumschiffahrt (VfR) (Society for Space
    Travel), which had been formed in 1927. The existence of organized
    groups like the VfR signaled the increasing fascination with modern
    rocketry in the 1930s, and there were frequent exchanges of
    information among the VfR and other groups like the British
    Interplanetary Society and the American Interplanetary Society. Even
    Goddard occasionally had correspondence in the American
    Interplanetary Society's Bulletin, but he remained aloof from other
    American researchers in general, cautious about his results, and
    concerned about patent infringement. Because of Goddard's reticence,
    in contrast to the more visible personalities in the VfR, and because
    of the publicity given the German V-2 of World War II, the work of
    British, American, and other groups has been overshadowed. If not as
    spectacular as the work on the V-2 rockets, their work nevertheless
    contributed to the growth of rocket technology in the prewar era and
    the successful use of a variety of Allied rocket weapons in the war.
    Although groups such as the American Interplanetary Society (which
    later became the American Rocket Society) succeeded in building and
    launching several small rockets, much of their significance lay in
    their role as the source of a growing number of technical papers on
    rocket technologies. But rocket [<A NAME="10"></A></FONT><B><FONT

    complex and expensive. The costs and the difficulties of planning and

    aircraft takeoff was especially successful. The project was known as
    JATO, for Jet-Assisted Take-Off, because the word rocket still
    carried negative overtones in many bureaucratic circles. During World
    War II, U.S. armed forces made wide use of the bazooka (an antitank

    batteries or from ships, and high-velocity air-to-surface missiles.

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the early 1930s, the VfR attracted the
    attention of the German Army because the Treaty of Versailles, which
    restricted some types of armaments, left the door open to rocket
    development, and the military began rocket research as a variation of
    long-range artillery. Captain Walter Dornberger, an Army artillery
    officer with advanced degrees in engineering, spearheaded military
    rocket development. One of his chief assistants was a 20-year-old
    enthusiast from the VfR, Wernher von Braun, who joined the
    organization in October 1932. By December 1932, the Army rocket group
    had static-fired a liquid-propellant rocket engine at the Army's
    proving ground near Kummersdorf, south of Berlin.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Wernher von Braun was born in 1912 at Wirsitz,
    Germany, in Posen Province, the second of three sons of Baron and
    Baroness Magnus von Braun. A present of a telescope in honor of his
    church confirmation started the youthful von Braun's interest in
    space, spurring him to write an article about an imaginary trip to
    the moon. Fascination with the prospects of space travel never left
    him, and in 1930 he joined the VfR, where he met Oberth and other
    rocket enthusiasts. At the same time, he attended the Charlottenburg
    Institute of Technology and did apprentice work at a machine factory
    in Berlin. Before completing his bachelor's degree in mechanical
    engineering in 1932, he had participated in the space-travel film
    project and had come into contact with German ordnance officers. This
    contact led to the Army's support of von Braun's doctoral research in
    rocket combustion, which he completed in a brief period of two years,
    and he received his degree from Friedrich-Wilhelms Universitat of
    Berlin in 1934.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By the next year, it became evident that the
    available test and research facilities at Kummersdorf were not going
    to be adequate for the scale of the hardware under development. A new
    location, shared jointly by the German Army and Air Force, was
    developed instead. Located on the island of Usedom in the Baltic, the
    new Peenemuende facility (named for the nearby Peene river) was
    geographically remote enough to satisfy military security and boasted
    enough land area, about 52 square kilometers, to permit adequate
    separation of test stands, research facilities, production areas, and
    residential sections. Test shots could be fired into
    [<A NAME="12"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">12</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] the Baltic Sea, avoiding impact in inhabited regions.
    Starting with about 80 researchers in 1936, the facility comprised
    nearly 5000 personnel by the time of the first launch of the V-2 in
    1942. Later in the war, with production in full swing, the work force
    numbered about 18 000.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The V-2 (from Vergeltungswaffen-2, or "weapon
    of retaliation") had no counterpart in the Allied inventory. The V-2
    was 14 meters long, with a diameter of 1.5 meters, and capable of
    speeds up to 5800 kilometers per hour to an altitude of 100
    kilometers. By the end of the war, Germany had launched nearly 3000
    of the remarkable V-2 weapons against targets in England and
    elsewhere in western Europe at ranges up to 320 kilometers. With the
    support of government, private, and university sources for research
    and development, the von Braun team at Peenemuende solved numerous
    hardware fabrication problems and technical difficulties (such as the
    production, storage, and handling of liquid oxygen in large
    quantity), while developing unique management skills in rocket
    technology.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Early in the V-2 development program, its
    creators began looking at the rocket in terms of its promise for
    space research as well as for military applications. The continuous
    undercurrent of fascination with space travel was real enough to land
    von Braun in the clutches of the Gestapo. Late in the war, the German
    SS made attempts to wrest control of Peenemuende from Dornberger.
    After von Braun himself turned down "direct overtures from SS
    chieftain Heinrich Himmler, he was arrested at two o'clock one
    morning by a trio of Gestapo agents. Following two weeks of
    incarceration in prison at Stettin, von Braun was hauled into an SS
    court to hear the charges against him. Among other accusations, his
    prosecutors accused him of opposing the V-2 strikes on England and
    charged that he was more interested in rocketry for space research
    than in rocketry for warfare. Dornberger had to intercede directly
    with Adolf Hitler to get von Braun released.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By early 1945, it was apparent that the war
    was nearing its end. Von Braun called a secret meeting of his top
    staff and reviewed their options: stay on at Peenemuende in the face
    of the advancing Russian units or try to head south and surrender to
    the Americans. There was no dissent-go south. In railroad cars,
    trucks, and automobiles emblazoned with red and white placards
    reading Vorhaben zur besonderen Verwendun (Project for Special
    Disposition), the Peenemuende convoy bluffed its way through military
    and Gestapo checkpoints, arriving in the Harz mountain region in
    Bavaria with tons of documents and hundreds of Peenemuende personnel
    and their families. After regrouping, the von Braun team, unaware
    that the United States was already formulating a program to round up
    leading German scientific and technical personnel, began making plans
    for contacting the Americans. Best known as Operation Paperclip, the
    American search for the von Braun team had top
    priority.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    Braun's younger brother Magnus climbed on a bicycle and set off down
    a country road in search of the Americans. Magnus was delegated for
    this delicate mission because he spoke better English. Contact was
    established, and several months of effort cleared the bureaucratic
    hurdles and prepared the way for over 100 selected German personnel
    to come to the United States. Finally, von Braun six others arrived
    at Fort Strong in Boston on 29 September l945. If the vanguard found
    the circumstances of their entry into the United States somewhat
    confusing and disorganized, they found American rocket development in
    much the same state of affairs.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The National Security Act of 1947 established
    a unified military organization under the Secretary of Defense, with
    separate and equal departments for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, and U.S.
    Air Force. In the nascent field of military rocketry, guidelines for
    responsibilities of research, development, and deployment were
    decidedly fuzzy. As a result, American missile development in the
    postwar era suffered from interservice rivalry and lack of strong
    overall coordination, a situation that persisted to the mid-1950s.
    The Air Force, successful in long-range bombardment operations during
    the war, made a strong case for leadership in missile development. On
    the other hand, the Navy worked up studies showing the capabilities
    of missile operations from ships and submarines, and the Army viewed
    missiles as logical adjuncts to heavy artillery. But the Air Force
    had initiated long-range missile development even before the end of
    the war, and this momentum gave them early preeminence in the field
    of missile development.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Because American missile technology did not
    yet have the capability for large rocket-propelled vehicles, the Air
    Force at first concentrated on winged missiles powered by
    air-breathing turbojet powerplants. The Air Force stable of cruise
    missiles possessed ranges from 1000 to 11 000 kilometers and were
    capable of carrying the heavy, awkward nuclear warheads produced in
    the early postwar era. Until the Atomic Energy Commission made
    lighter and less unwieldy warheads available, the Air Force pressed
    on with cruise missiles at the expense of development of
    rocket-powered intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as
    the Atlas. The Navaho project represented the peak of the cruise
    missile. Weighing in at 136 000 kilograms and capable of Mach 3
    speeds, the Navaho's research and development costs came to $690
    million. It never reached operational status before cancellation in
    1957, when ICBM technology overtook it. The Navaho made three
    successful flights, and the fallout from certain aspects of Navaho
    research and development [<A NAME="14"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">14</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] turned out to be
    very significant in other areas. The experience in high-speed
    aerodynamics was applied to other aeronautical research programs, and
    the missile's all-inertial guidance system found application in ICBMs
    and submarine navigational systems. Moreover, the booster units for
    Navaho were noteworthy in ICBM designs. Even though the Navaho used a
    ramjet engine for sustained flight to the target, the heavy vehicle
    was boosted into the air by three liquid-propellant rocket engines of
    600 000 newtons (135 000 pounds) of thrust each. Developed by
    Rocketdyne (a division of North American Aviation, Inc.), variants of
    these powerplants were developed for the Air Force's Thor and Atlas
    missiles, and for the Army's Redstone and Jupiter rockets. The rocket
    engines for the latter played a highly significant role in the
    evolution of the Saturn vehicles.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#1.11">11</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the early postwar era, while the Air Force
    developed cruise missiles, the Army generated an increasing expertise
    in liquid propulsion rocketry through special projects at the White
    Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. At White Sands, von Braun and the
    rocketry experts from Peenemuende not only made lasting contributions
    to American ballistic missile capabilities but made early ventures
    into space exploration. Besides test firing a series of captured V-2
    rockets for the Army's operational experience, the German experts
    helped coordinate a series of upper atmospheric research probes. One
    such project, known as the Bumper Series, employed a V-2 as the first
    stage with a Wac Corporal upper stage, one of which reached an
    altitude of 393 kilometers. In 1950, the last two Bumper launches
    took place in Florida, at the Long Range Proving Ground, located at
    Cape Canaveral-a prelude to U.S. space launches of the future.
    Another major activity included the Hermes program and involved the
    General Electric Company's working with the von Braun team under Army
    Ordnance cognizance. During Hermes operations, the basic V-2 rocket
    underwent successive modifications, increasing its performance
    envelope and payload capabilities, while giving the American
    contractors progressive experience in rocket technology. A number of
    more-or-less indigenous American vehicles were also flown. Although
    none became operational, they afforded a highly useful exposure to
    rocket development for government and contractor agencies alike, and
    one of the concepts, Hermes C-1, contributed directly to the
    development of the first significant American ballistic missile, the
    Army's Redstone.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
    FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="notes.htm#1.12">12</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the l940s drew to a close, the Army decided
    to establish a new center of rocket activity. Although White Sands
    remained active as a test range, a facility devoted to basic research
    and prototype hardware development was needed. A site selection team
    finally settled on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama.
    Established in 1941 for the production of various chemical compounds
    and pyrotechnic devices (including small
    [<A NAME="15"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">15</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] solid-fuel rockets), Redstone had all the necessary
    attributes: shops, laboratories, assembly areas, and ample
    surrounding land to ensure both security and space for static-firing
    tests. Moreover, it was accessible to the Long Range Proving Ground,
    a rocket launch area of growing significance at Cape Canaveral. The
    transfer of von Braun's work from Fort Bliss was approved, and the
    Ordnance Guided Missile Center was in operation in Huntsville by the
    close of 1950.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the Korean War, the new research center
    was assigned the development of a surface-to-surface ballistic
    missile with a range of 160 kilometers. A propulsion system adapted
    from the Navaho program enhanced rapid development, and the first
    launch of the new Redstone occurred at Cape Canaveral on 20 August
    1953. Before declaring it operational in 1958, the von Braun team
    fired 36 more test vehicles. The prolonged Redstone development
    program epitomized the thorough, step-by-step engineering
    conservatism developed during the early years of rocket development
    at Peenemuende. This conservatism was a continuing trait of the von
    Braun team throughout the evolution of the Saturn program. Another
    point of significance concerned the involvement of the Chrysler
    Corporation as the prime contractor who built the last 20 R&amp;D
    models and continued production of the operational models. The
    Chrysler connection provided valuable experience in government-
    contractor relationships that was the keynote of the development of
    the Saturn series of launch vehicles, and Chrysler, like Rocketdyne,
    also became an important contractor in the Saturn program.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the meantime, the accumulated design
    experience of the Redstone program contributed to a joint Army-Navy
    development program involving the Jupiter vehicle, a direct
    derivative of the Redstone. This short-lived but interesting
    cooperation had its origins in the immediate postwar era. Because the
    Navy had its own interests in rocket technology and the Army
    possessed a reasonable supply of V-2 rockets, the two services
    collaborated in experimental V-2 launches from the flight deck of the
    aircraft carrier Midway in 1947. At an altitude of 1500 meters above
    the carrier's deck, a missile disintegrated in a ball of flame and
    debris. The specter of catastrophe, if such a large liquid-fueled
    rocket accidentally exploded on a ship at sea and spewed its huge
    volume of volatile propellants everywhere, led the Navy to proceed
    cautiously with liquid-propellant rockets. Nevertheless, the
    Department of Defense encouraged the formation of the joint Army-Navy
    venture in ballistic missiles in 1955, and the Army's designated
    organization in the partnership was the Army Ballistic Missile Agency
    (ABMA), created in 1956 and staffed primarily out of von Braun's
    group at the Redstone Arsenal. Major General John B. Medaris became
    ABMA's commanding officer. Wise in the ways of military bureaucracy,
    the enterprising Medaris also won unusually wide latitude in
    determining the direction of ABMA's research and allocation
    [<A NAME="16"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">16</FONT></B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">] of funds. Medaris and the equally venturesome von
    Braun made ABMA a remarkably resourceful and aggressive organization,
    especially when ABMA found itself in a solo role in Jupiter's
    eventual development.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This situation came late in 1956, when naval
    experts decided to concentrate on solid-fuel rockets. This direction
    eliminated logistic and operational difficulties inherent in the
    deployment of liquid-propellant rockets in seaborne operations,
    particularly with missiles launched underwater from submarines. The
    Navy gave official authorization to its own strategic missile-the
    Polaris- early in 1957. Based on a solid-fuel motor, the Polaris
    nevertheless borrowed from the Jupiter program in the form of its
    guidance system, evolved from the prior collaboration of ABMA and the
    Navy.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">ABMA continued Jupiter development into a
    successful intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM), even though
    the Army eventually had to surrender its operational deployment to
    the Air Force when a Department of Defense directive late in 1956
    restricted the Army to missiles with a range of 320 kilometers or
    less. Even so, ABMA maintained a role in Jupiter R&amp;D, including
    high-altitude launches that added to ABMA's understanding of rocket
    vehicle operations in the near-Earth space environment. It was
    knowledge that paid handsome dividends later.</FONT></P>

    1950s, the Atomic Energy Commission successfully perfected smaller
    hydrogen-bomb warheads. In the Air Force, these warheads caused
    cruise missile development to be replaced by new emphasis on the Thor
    IRBM and the longer range missiles such as the Atlas intercontinental
    ballistic missile (ICBM). Successful launches of the single-stage
    Thor and the one-and-a-half-stage Atlas occurred in 1957 and 1958,
    and the Air Force also began work on an advanced ICBM, the Titan, a
    two-stage vehicle launched for the first time in 1959. The increasing
    payload capability of these various missiles opened the possibility
    of replacing their warheads with satellites and using them as
    boosters to launch heavy scientific payloads into space. The United
    States had already applied the growing expertise of rocket technology
    to the development of a family of sounding rockets to carry
    instrumentation for upper atmospheric research, such as the Navy's
    Aerobee and the Viking, which would reach altitudes between 160 and
    320 kilometers. During the period of the International Geophysical
    Year 1957-1958, many nations around the world conducted a coordinated
    program of sounding rocket launches, including 210 sent up by the
    United States and 125 launched by the Soviet Union. However, the
    United States had an even more ambitious goal than launching sounding
    rockets during the International Geophysical Year. America planned to
    orbit its first small satellite.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The satellite project began in 1955. In spite
    of the international spirit of cooperation inherent in International
    Geophysical Year programs, a strong sentiment in the United States
    was that America should not waste time and should attempt to orbit a
    satellite ahead of the Russians. For the booster, a blue-ribbon
    selection panel from military and industry analyzed a list of
    candidates that included the Atlas, the Redstone, and the Viking.
    ABMA argued that Atlas was still untested in 1955. The Viking
    vehicle, its opponents noted, still required a program to uprate its
    first-stage engines and develop new second and third stages before it
    could become operational. On the other hand, the Army's Jupiter C
    vehicle-a direct derivative of the proven Redstone-appeared to have
    all the capabilities necessary to launch a satellite successfully.
    For complex reasons, the committee selected the Viking; they argued
    that the Viking had been intended from the start as a vehicle for
    space research and that its development would not impinge on
    America's ballistic missile program, which was considered to be
    lagging behind the Russians' program. The choice of Viking, in the
    context of Cold War concerns over international prestige and
    technological leadership, was a controversial decision. The new
    program, to be known as Project Vanguard, was authorized in September
    1955 under the Department of the Navy.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    Vanguard with three "live" stages blew apart on the pad, and its
    successor veered off course and disintegrated before it had ascended
    six kilometers. As if these last two fiascos were not enough,
    Vanguard was already overtaken by events. The Russians had orbited
    Sputnik I on 4 October 1957. Within four weeks the Soviet Union
    demonstrated that Sputnik was no fluke by launching a second orbital
    payload; Sputnik II, carrying the dog "Laika," went into orbit on 3
    November.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The honor of launching America's first
    satellite fell to the close-knit group of pioneers who had dreamed of
    space exploration for so many years, the von Braun team. When the
    Army's Redstone-Jupiter candidate for the International Geophysical
    Year satellite was rejected, ABMA assumed a low profile but kept up
    work. As one ABMA insider explained, von Braun found a "diplomatic
    solution" to sustain development of the Jupiter C by testing nose
    cones for the reentry of warheads. Following launch, solid-propellant
    motors in the second and third stages accelerated an inert fourth
    stage attached to an experimental nose cone. The nose cones tested
    ablative protection as they reentered Earth's atmosphere. After
    successful tests during the summer of 1957, von Braun declared that a
    live fourth stage and a different trajectory would have given the
    United States its orbiter. In any case, ABMA was not unprepared to
    put an American payload into Earth orbit. Slightly more than four
    weeks after the launch of Sputnik, the Secretary of Defense finally
    acceded to persuasive pleas from ABMA to put up an artificial
    satellite, using its own vehicle. Authorization from the secretary
    for two satellite launches came on 8 November 1957, and the initial
    launch was set for 30 January 1958. ABMA missed the target date by
    only one day, when a Jupiter C orbited Explorer I on 31 January
    1958.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    FACE="Geneva"> The unqualified success of Explorer I and its
    successors derived in large part from the existing operational
    capability of the Jupiter C launch vehicle, from the flexibility of
    ABMA's in-house capability, and from the technical expertise of the
    Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which functioned administratively as
    a unit of the California Institute of Technology and got a large
    share of its funds through Army contracts. JPL developed the
    solid-fuel propulsion units for the upper stages of the Jupiter C as
    well as the payloads for the Explorer satellite. Within the next few
    months, the Jupiter C vehicles, designated as Juno boosters for space
    launches, also carried payloads into orbit around the moon and the
    sun.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the public consternation and political
    turmoil in the wake of the Soviet space spectaculars, the American
    government began a thorough reappraisal of its space program. One
    result was the establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration (NASA) in place [<A NAME="19"></A></FONT><B><FONT
    FACE="Geneva">19</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] of the old National
    Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). Created when President
    Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act into law on
    29 July 1958, NASA was organized to ensure strong civil involvement
    in space research so that space exploration would be undertaken for
    peaceful purposes as well as for defense. Although late in success,
    Project Vanguard was not without its benefits. Vanguard I finally got
    into orbit on 17 March 1958, and two more Vanguards attained orbit in
    1959. The program yielded important scientific results, as well as
    valuable operational experience. Upper stages of the Vanguard vehicle
    were used in conjunction with later booster vehicles such as the Thor
    and the Atlas, and the technique of gimbaled (movable) engines for
    directional control was adapted to other rockets.

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The period 1958-1959 seemed to trigger
    feverish activity in space exploration. In the months and years that
    followed, dozens of satellites and space vehicles were launched,
    including space probes that landed on Venus and the moon. Although
    other nations inaugurated space programs and launched their own
    boosters and scientific payloads, most public attention fastened on
    the manned "space race" between the U.S.S.R. and the United States.
    Within the first week of NASA's existence in October 1958, Project
    Mercury was authorized to put an American astronaut into orbit, and
    the space agency began negotiations to obtain the necessary boosters
    and select candidates for astronaut training.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At that time, NASA did not have the resources
    to develop its own boosters for space exploration. Mission planners
    reached into the inventory of American ballistic missiles and
    finalized agreements with the Army and ABMA for use of the Redstone,
    as well as the Atlas ICBM to be acquired from the Air Force. To check
    out requirements and systems for manned orbital operations, NASA
    planned to employ the Redstone for suborbital launches, and the more
    powerful Atlas would be used for the orbital missions. Selection of
    the first seven Mercury astronauts was announced in the spring of
    1959, and work proceeded on the development and testing of the
    Mercury space capsule, including unmanned test launches in 1960.
    Early in 1961 a Mercury-Redstone launch from Cape Canaveral carried
    the chimpanzee "Ham" over 640 kilometers down-range in an arching
    trajectory that reached a peak of 253 kilometers above Earth. The
    chimp's successful flight and recovery confirmed the soundness of the
    Mercury-Redstone systems and set the stage for a suborbital flight by
    an American astronaut. But the Americans were again upstaged by the
    Russians. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On 12 April 1961, Major Yuri Gagarin was
    launched aboard Vostok I and completed one full orbit to become the
    first human being to travel in orbit about the Earth. Just as the
    Russians appeared to have overtaken the Americans in the area of
    unmanned space projects, they now seemed to have forged ahead in
    manned exploration as well. Although Alan B. Shepard made a
    successful suborbital flight atop ABMA's Redstone

    overshadowed when Soviet Cosmonaut Gherman Titov roared into space
    aboard Vostok II on 6 August and stayed aloft for 17 1/2 orbits. It
    was not until the following year that Astronaut John H. Glenn became
    the first American to orbit the Earth. Boosted by a modified Atlas
    ICBM, Friendship 7 lifted off from Cape Canaveral on 20 February 1962
    and orbited the Earth three times before Glenn rode the capsule to
    splashdown and recovery in the Atlantic.</FONT></P>

    manned flights proved that humans could safely travel and perform
    various tasks in the hostile environment of space. Over the next few
    years, both Russian and American manned programs improved and refined
    booster and spacecraft systems, including multicrew missions. The
    Russians again led the way in such missions with the flight Voshkod I
    in 1964 (a three-man crew), and a Russian cosmonaut recovery in the
    Aleksey Leonov performed the first "space walk" during the Voshkod II
    mission in 1965. The same year, NASA began its own series of two-man
    launches with the Gemini program. With a modified Titan II ICBM as
    the booster, the first Gemini mission blasted off from Cape Kennedy
    on 23 March 1965, and the Gemini program, which continued into the
    winter of 1966, included the first American space walks, as well as
    highly important rendezvous and docking techniques. The maneuvers
    required to bring two separate orbiting spacecraft to a point of
    rendezvous, followed by the docking maneuver, helped pave the way for
    more ambitious manned space missions. Plans for multimanned space
    stations and lunar exploration vehicles depended on these rendezvous
    and docking techniques, as well as the ability of astronauts to
    perform certain tasks outside the protected environment of the
    spacecraft itself. The successive flights of the Mercury-Redstone,
    Mercury-Atlas, and Gemini-Titan missions were progressive elements in
    a grand design to launch a circumlunar mission to the moon and return

    <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Against the background of Mercury and Gemini
    developments, work was already progressing on the Apollo-Saturn
    program. The spacecraft for the Apollo adventure evolved out of the
    Mercury and Gemini capsule hardware, and other research and
    development was directed toward new technology required for a lunar
    lander and associated systems. A parallel effort involved the
    development of an entirely different family of boosters. Heretofore,
    NASA had relied on existing boosters requisitioned from the armed
    services-the Redstone missile, along with Thor, Atlas, and Titan. For
    manned lunar missions, a rocket of unusual thrust and lifting
    capacity was called for-literally, a giant of a booster. During 1960,
    the von Braun team was transferred from ABMA to NASA, bringing not
    only its conceptual understanding of manned space flight (based on
    preliminary studies in 1957 and 1959) but also its acknowledged
    skills in the development of rockets. For manned missions, the von
    Braun team developed a totally different big booster-the
